Renowned for his inventiveness as well as for his bombast and irascibility, Randel was central to Manhattan&#x2019;s development but died in financial ruin. Telling Randel&#x2019;s engrossing and dramatic life story for the first time, this eye-opening biography introduces an unheralded pioneer of American engineering and mapmaking. <p>Charged with &#x201c;gridding&#x201d; what was then an undeveloped, hilly island, Randel recorded the contours of Manhattan down to the rocks on its shores. He was obsessed with accuracy and steeped in the values of the Enlightenment, in which math and science promised dominion over nature. The result was a series of maps, astonishing in their detail and precision, which undergird our knowledge about the island today. During his varied career Randel created surveying devices, designed an early elevated subway, and proposed a controversial alternative route for the Erie Canal&#x2015;winning him admirers and enemies.</p><p><em>The Measure of Manhattan</em> is more than just the life of an unrecognized engineer. It is about the ways in which surveying and cartography changed the ground beneath our feet. Bringing Randel&#x2019;s story into the present, Holloway travels with contemporary surveyors and scientists trying to envision Manhattan as a wild island once again. Illustrated with dozens of historical images and antique maps, <em>The Measure of Manhattan</em> is an absorbing story of a fascinating man that captures the era when Manhattan&#x2015;indeed, the entire country&#x2015;still seemed new, the moment before canals and railroads helped draw a grid across the American landscape.</p> 24 illustrations</p><p>Marguerite Holloway, the director of Science and Environmental Journalism at Columbia University, has written for Scientific American, Discover, the New York Times, Natural History, and Wired. She lives in Manhattan with her husband and two children.&#x201c;<em>The Measure of Manhattan</em> offers a fascinating look at a forgotten episode in American history. Marguerite Holloway brings to life the man who in a very real way made New York what it is today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Kolbert, author of <i>Field Notes From a Catastrophe</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With the grid he laid down, John Randel Jr. transformed an island of 18th Century villages into the modern linear city&#x2015;a mind-boggling achievement in ferociously meticulous surveying that reads, in <em>The Measure of Manhattan</em>, like a wilderness adventure, angry farmers standing in for the wild animals already hunted away. Marguerite Holloway&#x2019;s portrait of the surveyor&#x2019;s surveyor in his cartography-obsessed time shows us how much the physical city has changed and, most importantly, how much it hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Sullivan, author of <i>My American Revolution</i> and <i>Rats</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As elegant as the maps it celebrates, Marguerite Holloway&#x2019;s lively biography tells the story of the man who pinned a grid to Manhattan.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edward Dolnick, author of <i>The Clockwork Universe</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This outstanding history of the Manhattan grid offers us a strange archaeology: part spatial adventure, part technical expedition into the heart of measurement itself, starring teams of 19th-century gentlemen striding across the island&#x2019;s eroded mountains and wild streams, implementing a grid that would soon enough sprout skyscrapers and flatirons, Central Park and Fifth Avenue. Marguerite Holloway&#x2019;s engaging survey takes us step by step through the challenges of obsolete land laws and outdated maps of an earlier metropolis, looking for&#x2015;and finding&#x2015;the future shape of this immeasurable city.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Geoff Manaugh, <em>BLDGBLOG</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marguerite Holloway has created an enchanting web of biography and science, as magical as the grid that John Randel devised to give birth to modern Manhattan.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andro Linklater, author of <i>Measuring America</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This intelligent and entirely riveting account of the brave young man who squared and sculpted Manhattan, and made famous its present street geometry, is every bit as groundbreaking a success as was his own work, two centuries before. Marguerite Holloway has uncovered in the life of John Randel Jr., a quite marvelous tale, and has told it just magnificently.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Simon Winchester, author of <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>The Map That Changed the World</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In gracefully efficient prose, Marguerite Holloway, who heads Columbia University&#x2019;s Science and Environmental Journalism program, gives the reader a vivid sense of the challenges facing Randel, the social context that informed his epic undertaking, and the will and ingenuity that he brought to the task...an enlightening ode to a man who made sense of a budding metropolis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kevin Canfield, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong></p><h2>170 Years of Show Business</h2><p>Kate Mostel (Author) Madeline Gilford (Author) 170 Years of Show Business [Hardcover] 175 pages Publisher: Random House; 1st edition (1978)</p><p></p><h2>American Tabloid: A Novel</h2><p>We are behind, and below, the scenes of JFK's presidential election, the Bay of Pigs, the assassination--in the underworld that connects Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, D.C. . . . <br><br>Where the CIA, the Mob, J.

It does so by examining interactions between U.S. soldiers and members of host communities in the three locations&#x2014;South Korea, Japan and Okinawa, and West Germany&#x2014;where more than-two thirds of American overseas bases and troops have been concentrated for the past six decades. The essays in this collection highlight the role of cultural and racial assumptions in the maintenance of the American military base system, and the ways that civil-military relations play out locally. Describing how political, spatial, and social arrangements shape relations between American garrisons and surrounding communities, they emphasize such factors as whether military bases are located in democratic nations or in authoritarian countries where cooperation with dictatorial regimes fuels resentment; whether bases are integrated into neighboring communities or isolated and surrounded by &#x201c;camp towns&#x201d; wholly dependent on their business; and whether the United States sends single soldiers without families on one-year tours of duty or soldiers who bring their families and serve longer tours. Analyzing the implications of these and other situations, the contributors address U.S. military&#x2013;regulated relations between GIs and local women; the roles of American women, including military wives, abroad; local resistance to the U.S. military presence; and racism, sexism, and homophobia within the U.S. military. <i>Over There</i> is an essential examination of the American military as a global and transnational phenomenon.<p></p><p>Contributors<br>Donna Alvah <br>Chris Ames <br>Jeff Bennett <br>Maria H�hn <br>Seungsook Moon <br>Christopher Nelson <br>Robin Riley <br>Michiko Takeuchi</p></p><p>"<i>Over There</i> is a splendid book.

Written more than two decades after <i>Democracy and Education</i> (Dewey's most comprehensive statement of his position in educational philosophy), this book demonstrates how Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of his intervening experience with the progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms his theories had received. <p> Analyzing both "traditional" and "progressive" education, Dr. Dewey here insists that neither the old nor the new education is adequate and that each is miseducative because neither of them applies the principles of a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeped and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive "ism" about education, even such an "ism" as "progressivism." His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, on that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.</p></p><p>John Dewey, philosopher and social critic, was the author of more than twenty books. He was a professor at Columbia University and a writer for <i>The New Republic</i>. He died in 1952.&nbsp;&#34;No one has done more to keep alive the fundamental ideals of liberal civilization.&#34; -- Morris R. Cohen</p><h2>The Game of Thirty</h2><p><i>Streetwise PI Jimmy McShane</i> has seen plenty, but he's never seen anything like the murder of Tommy Rennseler. A wealthy antiques dealer with a passion for Egyptian artifacts, Rennseler was killed like an ancient Egyptian: injected with cobra venom and ritually disembowelled. When he's hired by the dead man's daughter, McShane realizes that he's never seen anything like Temple Rennseler, either. She's beautiful, exotic and -&nbsp; obsessed with the Game of 30, a centuries-old form of chess that - perhaps - foretells the future. As McShane gets closer to the killer, he finds himself trapped in a more deadly game, with Manhattan as the gameboard.</p><p>Meet Jimmy McShane, private eye: street-smart, female-ogling, smart-mouthed, sharp-dressing--well, you know the type. (Picture Bruce Willis in the movie version.) His sidekick is Jane Henderson, a quick-witted, Rollerblading--and yes, gorgeous--chiropractor with such this-must-be-the-'90s obsessions as herbal healing and aromatherapy. (Demi Moore, perhaps?) This is one of those books that make you wonder why they didn't just go straight to the screenplay. Lots of great New York scenery, from uptown to Chinatown to the bowels of 42nd Street, lots of colorful stock characters, lots of scenes that sound like they were written with a film crew in mind. The plot itself is enjoyably silly, for a time, involving the annoyingly leering yet brashly endearing McShane in a quest for the killer of a Madison Avenue antiquities dealer who specializes in ancient Egyptian artifacts. His client is the dealer's daughter, Temple (picture Julia Roberts in one of her trademark damsel-in- distress roles), who has legs that won't quit and a confused, little-girl-lost demeanor that keep our hero's heart thumping and pull him deeper and deeper into the mysteries behind the perfectly composed masks of his upper-crust suspects. The book's title refers to an Egyptian board game that is said to reflect the state of its players' lives and handily serves just this purpose in the novel, predicting each move the characters make in a gamelike plot. If that's not enough to clue you in on what will happen next, there's plenty of author-supplied foreshadowing. Unfortunately, the mood devolves from over-the-top good fun to something darker and decidedly unfun during the latter half of the book, and the denouement, despite all the hints, comes as a too preposterous and sentimental letdown. Kotzwinkle (The Exile, 1987, etc.) is best here when he sticks to wisecracking skepticism and avoids the TV-movie drama. (First serial to Esquire; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>When a first-class mainstream writer turns his hand to genre fiction, the results are seldom mediocre. They're usually either spectacular or awful. Like Richard Brautigan's <i>Dreaming of Babylon</i> (1977), Kotzwinkle's venture into crime fiction is first rate, a delight to read and a successful attempt to expand the horizons of the genre. Making masterful use of the first-person narrative form common to most hard-boiled detective fiction, Kotzwinkle introduces Jimmy McShane, who is hired to solve the grisly murder of a shady dealer in rare antiquities. Pitted against a killer whose methods include cobra venom and disembowelment, McShane is joined by Dr. Ann Henderson, a chiropractor and aspiring sleuth. It turns out that the deceased was killed while playing the Game of Thirty, an ancient Egyptian board game, and that the killer is playing the game with Jimmy, using all of New York City as the board. Played by the pharaohs, the Game of Thirty is designed to parallel an individual's journey toward either life or death. Laced with a liberal measure of Kotzwinkle's signature wit, this multileveled story is imaginatively constructed and populated with an engaging menagerie of characters both fair and foul. Unique and compelling. <i>Elliott Swanson</i></p><h2>The Natural Man</h2><p>In Needmore, Kentucky, in the late 1940s, bookish high school senior Harry Eastep is appointed mentor to Monk McHorning, the hulking hope of the high school basketball team, in a comic novel about the pains of youth and the possibilities of integrity</p><p>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>They Found Him Dead</h2><p>&#34;I shouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if somebody got murdered here tonight.

Of all the heroic stories to come out of World War II, few are so extraordinary as that of Major Rocky Gause, who was captured by the Japanese, escaped from the infamous Bataan Death March, and, with a fellow soldier, endured a harrowing voyage across the enemy-held Pacific in a leaky, hand-crafted boat. In the battered notebook he kept throughout his journey and later converted to a thrilling narrative, Gause traced his steps from the besieged city of Manila on New Years Eve, 1941, to his safe landing on the Australian coast ten months later.</p><p>Damon L. Gause, the son of Rocky Gause, was invited by the Philippine Ambassador to the United States to speak at the dedication of the American-Philippine War memorial. A frequent speaker before veterans' groups, he is a general contractor living in Georgia. <p>Mr. Gause cordially invites all readers to correspond with him at damongause@aol.com.</p>An American pilots remarkable diary, copied in a small notebook hidden in a footlocker for over 50 years, records his amazing escape from the notorious March of Death ordeal inflicted by Japanese soldiers on American and Filipino POW's and his further dangerous adventures during the last days of Bataan and Corregidor in the 1942 Philippines. The diary records how Gause, an army pilot without a plane since MacArthur's aircraft were destroyed on the ground after the Japanese sneak attack on Luzon, joined an American infantry unit to continue fighting against a swarming, ruthless enemy that pushed the gallant defenders from Manila to the dense jungles and killing fields of Bataan. Gause was one of the 78,000 American and Filipino soldiers running out of food, medicines, and ammunition who were captured by the Japanese. Nearly 60,000 died in captivity from hunger, thirst, disease, and murder. Gause escaped into the jungle after killing a Japanese sentry and swam through shark-infested waters to Corregidor amid brushes with death from enemy patrols. He found and repaired an abandoned fishing boat and undertook an unbelievable voyage to other islands and Australia after meeting another escaped American officer. Only the constant help and courage of patriotic Filipinos and other natives protected the two Americans from tropical storms, hunger, mosquitoes, and Japanese planes and ships. Gause and Osborne subsisted on raw fish, coconuts, bananas, rice, and rainwater. A Nazi agent dressed as an American colonel tried to kill them while they slept, but they were able to overpower the spy and leave him for dead. After many close calls during a harrowing 3,200 mile voyage to Australia and freedom, they were presented to General MacArthur ten months after the fall of Manila. The two were awarded Distinguished Service Crosses and then sent home for a well-deserved furlough. A suspenseful odyssey, rescued from obscurity, that honors two valiant and resourceful soldiers who never gave up hope to survive an impossible nightmare. A worthy addition to the rich lore of WWII.

My daughter had her hands tied behind her back, the skin on the wrists raw with the ropes, and her ankles bound. Her mouth was gagged to stop her cursing her father, her cowardly, two-tongued father. Nonetheless, her muffled screams were heard when she finally realized that her father really did mean to murder her, that he did mean to sacrifice her life for his army. They had cropped her hair with haste and carelessness; one of the women managed to cut into the skind around my daughter's skull with a rusty blade, and when Iphigenia began her curse, that is when they tied an old cloth around her mouth so that her words could not be heard. I am proud that she never ceased to struggle, that never once, not for one second, despite the ingratiating speech she had made, did she accept her fate. She did not give up trying to loosen the twine around her ankles or the ropes around her wrists so that she could get away from them. Or stop trying to curse her father so that he would feel the weight of her contempt.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No one is willing now to repeat the words she spoke in the moments before they muffled her voice, but I know what those words were. I taught them to her. They were words I made up to shrivel her father and his followers, with their foolish aims, they were words that announced what would happen to him and those around him once the news spread of how they dragged our daughter, the proud and beautiful Iphigenia, to that place, how they pulled her through the dust to sacrifice her so they might prevail in their war. In that last second as she lived, I am told she screamed aloud so that her voice pierced the hearts of those who heard her. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her screams as they murdered her were replaced by silence and by scheming when Agamemnon, her father, returned and I fooled him into thinking that I would not retaliate. I waited and I watched for signs, and smiled and opened my arms to him, and I had a table here prepared with food. Food for the fool! I was wearing the special scent that excited him. Scent for the fool!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was ready as he was not, the hero home in glorious victory, the blood of his daughter on his hands, but his hands white, his arms outstretched to embrace his friends, his face all smiles, the great soldier who would soom, he believed, hold up a cup in celebration and put rich food into his mouth. His gaping mouth! Relieved that he was home!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw his hands clench in sudden pain, clench in the grim, shocked knowledge that at last it had come to him, and in his own palace, and in the slack time when he was sure he would enjoy the old stone bath and the ease to be found there. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was what inspired him to go on, he said, the thought that this was waiting for him, healing water and spices and soft, clean clothes and familiar air and sounds. He was like a lion as he laid his muzzle down, his roaring all done, his body limp, and all thought of danger far from his mind. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled and said that, yes, I too had thought of the welcome I would make for him. He had filled my waking life and my dreams, I told him. I had dreamed of him rising all cleansed from the perfumed water of the bath. I told him his bath was being prepared as the food was being cooked, as the table was being laid, and as his friends were gathering. And he must go there now, I said, he must go to the bath. He must bathe, bathe in the relief of being home. Yes, home. That is where the lion came. I knew what to do with the lion once he came home.</p><h2>Deeper Places: Experiencing God in the Psalms</h2><p>People typically have two ways of thinking about spirituality. Either they have accepted the false reality that they can only know <i>about</i> God, without knowing him personally, or they have romanticized spirituality to such an extent that it becomes far too otherworldly.

Ebert caught on early that the rice cooker is the crock pot&#x2019;s virtual twin and can readily duplicate it as a time- and labor-saving appliance.

The conventional answer asserts that superior technology, tactics, and institutions forged by Darwinian military competition gave Europeans a decisive advantage in war over other civilizations from 1500 onward. In contrast, <i>Empires of the Weak</i> argues that Europeans actually had no general military superiority in the early modern era. J. C. Sharman shows instead that European expansion from the late fifteenth to the late eighteenth centuries is better explained by deference to strong Asian and African polities, disease in the Americas, and maritime supremacy earned by default because local land-oriented polities were largely indifferent to war and trade at sea.</p><p>Europeans were overawed by the mighty Eastern empires of the day, which pioneered key military innovations and were the greatest early modern conquerors. Against the view that the Europeans won for all time, Sharman contends that the imperialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was a relatively transient and anomalous development in world politics that concluded with Western losses in various insurgencies. If the twenty-first century is to be dominated by non-Western powers like China, this represents a return to the norm for the modern era.</p><p>Bringing a revisionist perspective to the idea that Europe ruled the world due to military dominance, <i>Empires of the Weak</i> demonstrates that the rise of the West was an exception in the prevailing world order.</p></p><p><b>J.

This book should make a big impact.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Barry Buzan, London School of Economics </b><br><br>&#x201c;In this provocative book, J. C. Sharman argues that European expansion between 1500 and 1800 succeeded in the creation of the first global system in world history by submission rather than domination.

Instead, <i>Empires of the Weak</i> argues that European expansion had much more to do with deference to local polities and the cultivation of local allies. A pleasure to read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Paul K. MacDonald, Wellesley College</b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Empires of the Weak</i>, J. C. Sharman persuasively shows that the triumphalist narrative of European dominance over &#x2018;backward&#x2019; polities in Asia, Africa, and the Americas is wrong. Moreover, Sharman challenges the conventional understanding of competition and military innovation. By illuminating the European encounter with the Asian great powers, his argument raises skepticism regarding the continuation of Western dominance of the international system.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Hendrik Spruyt, Northwestern University</b></p><h2>Return of the Jedi (Star Wars, Episode VI)</h2><p>The Emperor.

Here with New York Times science writer Blakeslee, Wallerstein explicitly hopes to complement Dr. Spock and Dr. T. Berry Brazelton&#x2019;s child rearing how-tos by showing parents how to guide children through the dissolution of a marriage. She does an excellent job. After a chapter that advises parents to get their own heads straight before dealing with the kids ("I wish I could tell you that it&#x2019;s ok to lie down and pull the covers over your head, but that&#x2019;s not possible"), Wallerstein addresses the developmental problems that infants and toddlers might face and ways of easing them into differing options for care. She&#x2019;s forthright in talking about the reactions of older children ("Teenagers can be excellent manipulators. All of them do it, but children of divorce have much more to work with"), and talks about their needs with empathy, insight and rigor, but never loses sight of what parents need and feel, too. Chapters cover "The Breakup," "Parent to Parent" advice on custody and avoiding disputes, "The Post-Divorce Family," "Second Marriage" and "Conversations for a Lifetime," or talks that help kids not to be afraid of love and commitment. Addressing everything from parent-to-parent blame to the many forms of child-to-parent resentment, Wallerstein offers firm honesty and supportive encouragement. Divorcing parents will be grateful for it, and a confirmed Today show appearance and satellite TV tour should help spread the word. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christopher&#39;s Diary: Secrets of Foxworth</h2><p>[ Christopher&#39;s Diary: Secrets of Foxworth Andrews, V.

I had come out of the kitchen, where I had just finished the breakfast dishes, and I saw him in the entryway pulling on his reluctant knee-high rubber boots, the muscles in his neck and face looking like rubber bands ready to snap. He already had his khaki &#x201c;aged like wine&#x201d; leather coat and faded U.S. Navy cap on. His tool belt lay beside him on the oak wood bench he had built, its heavy leather belt curled on itself like some sleeping snake. It had been a birthday present from my mother nearly ten years ago, but with the tender loving care he gave it, it looked like it had been bought yesterday.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t surprised to see him dressing like this. It was October, and we were having weird weather. Some days were cooler than usual, and then suddenly, some days were much warmer, and we also had more rainy ones in Charlottesville for this time of the year. Whenever anyone complained about the unusual changes in the weather, Dad loved to resurrect an old &#x2019;50s expression, &#x201c;Blame it on the Russians,&#x201d; rather than just saying &#x201c;Climate change.&#x201d; Most people had no idea what &#x201c;Blame it on the Russians&#x201d; meant, least of all any of my friends, and few had the patience to listen to any explanation he might have. Dad wasn&#x2019;t old enough to personally remember, of course, but he told me his father had said it so often that it became second nature for him, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Didn&#x2019;t I say anything about it at breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say much about anything this morning, Dad. You had your nose in the newspaper most of the time, sniffing the words instead of reading them,&#x201d; I reminded him. He said that was something my mother would complain about, too. She used the exact same expression. She told him that eating breakfast with him was like sleepwalking through a meal.<br> <br>My reliance on any of my mother&#x2019;s expressions, whether vaguely remembered or coming from my dad&#x2019;s descriptions, always brought a broad smile to his face. As if he had tiny dimmer switches behind them, his hazel eyes would brighten. Perhaps because of his constant time in the sun or his worry and sorrow, the lines in his forehead deepened and darkened more each year. His closely trimmed reddish-brown full-face beard had been showing a little premature gray in it lately, too. Dad was only forty-six, and ironically, there was no gray in his full head of thick hair, which he kept long but neatly trimmed. He wore it the same way he had when my mother was alive. He said she was jealous of how naturally rich and thick it was and forbade him to return to the military-style cut he had when they first met.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got to go inspect this mansion that burned down a second time in 2003. Herm Cromwell called me at the office just before I left yesterday, and I promised to do it today and get back to him even though it&#x2019;s the weekend. Bank&#x2019;s open half a day today. He&#x2019;s been working hard on taking the property off the bank&#x2019;s liabilities since that nutcase abandoned it and went off to preach the gospel. Herm wants me to estimate the removal and see if the basement is still intact. The bank has a live one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A live one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A client considering buying and building on the property, which, after two fires and all that bizarre history, hasn&#x2019;t been easy to sell. Why? What are you doing today? What did I forget? Was I supposed to do something with you, go somewhere with you?&#x201d; He pulled his lips back like someone who was anticipating a gust of bad news or criticism.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m not doing anything special. I was going to pick up Lana and hang out at the mall.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lately, Lana and I had become inseparable. I was close with many of my girlfriends, but Lana&#x2019;s parents were divorced, and sometimes her problems seemed close to mine, even if divorce wasn&#x2019;t what made my father a single parent.<br> <br>He relaxed, smiled, and shook his head gently. &#x201c; &#x2018;Hang out?&#x2019; You make me think of Mrs. Wheeler&#x2019;s laundry. She still doesn&#x2019;t have a dryer in her house. Don&#x2019;tcha know they call you kids &#x2018;mall rats&#x2019; these days? I hear they&#x2019;re coming up with a spray or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed but nodded. Ever since I got my driver&#x2019;s license last year, I looked for places to go, if for nothing else but the drive. As I watched Dad continue getting ready to leave, I thought about what he had said for a moment. And then it hit me: inspect the foundation of a mansion that had burned down a second time?<br> <br>&#x201c;This property you&#x2019;re going to, it&#x2019;s not Foxworth Hall, is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused as if he wasn&#x2019;t sure he should tell me and then nodded. &#x201c;Sure is,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Foxworth, I thought. I had seen the property only once, and not really close up, but all of us knew the legends that began with the first building, before the first fire. More important, my mother had been third cousin to Malcolm Foxworth, which made me a distant cousin of the children who supposedly had been locked in the attic of the mansion for years. So much of that story was changed and exaggerated over time that no one really knew the whole truth. At least, that was what my father told me.<br> <br>The man who had inherited it, Bart Foxworth, was weird, and no one had much to do with him. If anything, the way he had lived in the restored mansion only reinforced all the strange stories about the Foxworth family. He had little to do with anyone in the community and always had someone between him and anyone he employed. They called him another Phantom of the Opera. He had family living with him, but they had different names, and people believed they were cousins, too. One of them, who lived there only a few years before dying in a car accident, was a doctor who worked in a lab at the University of Charlottesville. Except for him, the feeling was that insanity ran in the family like tap water. At least, that was the way my father put it when he was pushed to say anything, which he hated to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to come along,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Three years before my mother had died, Foxworth Hall had burned down for a second time. I was just five years and five months old at the time of her death. I really didn&#x2019;t know very much about the place until I was twelve and one of my classmates, Kyra Skewer, discovered from gossip she had overheard when her mother was on the phone with friends that I was a distant cousin of the Foxworths. She began to tell others in my class, and before I knew it, they were looking at me a little oddly. Because everyone assumed the Foxworth family was crazy, many believed that their madness streamed through the blood of generations and possibly could have infected mine. The stories about the legendary Malcolm Foxworth and others in the family were the kind told around campfires at night when everyone was challenged to tell a scary tale. This one&#x2019;s parents or that one&#x2019;s uncle or someone&#x2019;s older brother swore they had seen ghosts and even unexplainable lantern lights in the night.<br> <br>Few tales were scarier to me or my classmates than this one story about four children locked in an attic for more than three years. All of them got very sick, and one of them, the youngest boy, died. Some believed that their mother and their grandmother wouldn&#x2019;t take them to a doctor or a hospital. From that, others concluded that either both or just the grandmother maybe wanted them all dead. Part of the story was that the young boy might have been buried on the property. And on Halloween, there was always someone who proposed going to Foxworth, because the legend was that on that night, the little boy&#x2019;s spirit roamed the grounds looking and calling for his brother and two sisters, even after the second fire. Some of my friends actually went there, but I never did, nor did Lana or Suzette, my other close friend. The stories those who did go brought back only enhanced the legend and kept the mystery alive. Some swore they had heard a little boy moaning and crying for his brother and sisters, and others claimed that they definitely had seen a small ghost.<br> <br>Whatever was the truth, the stories and distortions made the property quite undesirable ever since. Since Bart Foxworth had abandoned the property, it had been quite neglected and eventually fell into foreclosure. So it was curious that someone was considering buying it. Whoever it was obviously was not afraid of the legends and curses. Bart Foxworth, in fact, was said to have believed that his reconstruction of the original building still contained evil, and that was why he left it and didn&#x2019;t care to keep it up. It was said that he believed that God didn&#x2019;t want that house standing. It was as though a dark cloud never left the property. People accepted the curse. Where else could you find a house with that kind of history that had burned to the ground twice? Who&#x2019;d want to challenge the curse?<br> <br>&#x201c;Well if you want to come along, Kristin, get moving. Put on some boots and maybe a scarf. I have a lot to do there and want to get home for lunch and watch the basketball game this afternoon,&#x201d; Dad said, and he clapped his black-leather-gloved hands together. &#x201c;Chop, chop,&#x201d; he added, which was his favorite expression to get someone moving.<br> <br>My father had a construction company, simply called Masterwood, which was our last name. &#x201c;With a name like mine,&#x201d; Dad would say, &#x201c;what could I eventually do but get involved in construction?&#x201d; Masterwood employed upward of ten men, depending on the number of jobs contracted. My mother used to keep the books, but now Dad had Mrs. Osterhouse, a widow five years younger than he was whose husband had been one of Dad&#x2019;s friends. I knew she wanted Dad to marry her, but I didn&#x2019;t think he would ever bring another woman into our home permanently. He rarely dated and generally avoided all the meetings with women that anyone tried to arrange. For the last five years, I did most of our housework, and even when my mother was alive, Dad often prepared our meals, especially on weekends.<br> <br>Right after serving in the navy, where he got into cooking, he had been a short-order cook in a diner-type restaurant off I-95. He met my mother before he began taking on side work at construction companies. She was a bookkeeper at one of them. Two years later, they married and moved here to Charlottesville, Virginia, where they both put their life savings into my father&#x2019;s new company. They didn&#x2019;t deliberately come here because she&#x2019;d once had family here. My mother had never been invited to the Foxworth mansion, and hadn&#x2019;t ever spoken to Malcolm or anyone else who had lived there. Dad said they not only moved in different circles from the Foxworth clan but also lived on different planets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Wait for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ran upstairs to put on warmer clothing. I was actually very excited about going with him to Foxworth. I always thought Dad knew more than he ever had said about the original story, and maybe now, because we were going there, he would tell me more. Getting him to say anything new about it was like struggling to open one of those hard plastic packages that electronic things came wrapped in. When I came home from school armed with a new question about the family, usually because of something one of my classmates had said, he rarely gave any answers that were more than a grunt or monosyllable.<br> <br>My cell phone buzzed just as I was turning to leave my room. It was Lana. In my excitement, I had forgotten about her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time are you picking me up?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have lunch at the mall.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Change of plan. I&#x2019;m going with my father to Foxworth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Foxworth? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He has to estimate a job, and I promised I would help, take notes and stuff,&#x201d; I added, justifying my going there. &#x201c;Someone wants to build on the property.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ugh. Who&#x2019;d want to do that? It&#x2019;s cursed. There are probably bodies buried there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone who doesn&#x2019;t care about gossip and knows the value of the property,&#x201d; I said dryly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what businessmen do, look for a bargain and build it into a big profit.&#x201d;<br> <br>My father said I had inherited my condescending, often sarcastic sense of humor from my mother, who he claimed could cut up snobs in seconds and scatter their remains at her feet &#x201c;like bird feed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Well, what about Kane and Stanley? We were supposed to hang out with them, me with Stanley and you with Kane. I know for a fact that he&#x2019;s expecting you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I never said for sure, and he was quite offhanded about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you never said no, and I know you liked him before when we were out. Emily Grace told me her brother told her Kane said he thinks you&#x2019;ve grown into a pretty girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so grateful for his approval.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed. &#x201c;You like him, too. Don&#x2019;t play innocent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right. You never want any boy to take you for granted,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to disappoint him now and then.&#x201d; She was right, though. I really wanted to be with Kane, but I wanted to go to Foxworth more. I couldn&#x2019;t explain why. It had just come over me, and when I had feelings this strong, I usually paid attention to them.<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Who told you that? Are you reading some advice to the lovelorn or something? You&#x2019;re not listening to Tina Kennedy, are you? She&#x2019;s just jealous, jealous of everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Of course not. I&#x2019;d never listen to Tina Kennedy about anything. Gotta go,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s waiting for me. I&#x2019;ll call you later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch anything there,&#x201d; she warned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get infected with the madness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You forgot I had the shot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What shot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The vaccine that prevents insanity. It&#x2019;s how I can hang out with you,&#x201d; I added, and hung up before she could say another word. Besides, I knew she wanted to be on the phone instantly to spread the news. I was returning to some ancient ancestral burial ground, and surely the experience would change me in some dramatic way. They all might even become a little more afraid of me, but probably not Kane. If anything, I was sure he would find it amusing. He could be a terrific tease, which was one of the reasons I was a little afraid of him.<br> <br>Laughing, I bounced down the stairs. I had my blond hair tied in a ponytail, and because of the length of my hair, the ends bounced just above my wing bones. Both my mother and I had cerulean-blue eyes, and part of the legend of the attic children was that they all had the same blue eyes and blond hair. The fact that I supposedly looked like them only enhanced the theory that I could have inherited the family madness.<br> <br>I had never seen a picture of them, and Dad told me that he and my mother hadn&#x2019;t, either. In fact, no one had seen any picture of them when they were shut up in the attic or even soon afterward. There were some drawings in newspaper stories, but their accuracy was always in question, as were the facts in the stories. Supposedly, the children who survived the ordeal never talked about what had happened, but that didn&#x2019;t stop the tales of horror. They were always reprinted around Halloween with grotesque drawings depicting children scratching on locked windows, their faces resembling Edvard Munch&#x2019;s famous painting The Scream, making it all look like someone&#x2019;s nightmare. In a few weeks, those stories and pictures would appear again.<br> <br>Years later, three of the children, as the story goes, returned to Charlottesville just before the second fire. Dad said neither he nor my mother had ever met any of them. Some people believed that the older sister had begun an affair with her mother&#x2019;s attorney husband and that her mother was driven to madness and had actually been the one responsible for s...</p><h2>Uphill Battle: Cycling&#39;s Great Climbers</h2><p>This book, rich in anecdote and history, explores in words and pictures the world of uphill cycling.

Now includes &#39;The Deep&#39;, which was awarded the 2011 Sunday Times Short Story Award. In the luminous title story, a young boy in South Africa comes to possess an old woman&#39;s secret, a piece of the past with the power to redeem a life. In &#39;The River Nemunas&#39;, a teenaged orphan moves from Kansas to Lithuania, and discovers a world in which myth becomes real. And in &#39;Afterworld,&#39; a woman who escaped the Holocaust is haunted by visions of her childhood friends in Germany, yet finds solace in the tender ministrations of her grandson. The stories in Memory Wall show us how we figure the world, and show Anthony Doerr to be a master of the form.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2010</strong>: Books made of linked stories, like recent award-winning favorites <em>Olive Kitteridge</em> and <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>, are usually connected by shared places and people. The tender and lyrical stories in Anthony Doerr's <em>Memory Wall</em> are linked no less strongly, but, as if Oliver Sacks had turned to fiction, by a neurological theme. Set as far apart as South Africa and the Korean DMZ, Doerr's stories circle around the central pull of memory, both the struggle against memory's loss and the weight of memories that remain. In the long and brilliantly intricate title story, as memories fade from an aging white woman in suburban Cape Town, they are stored for her (and for anyone else with compatible ports installed in their head) in replayable cartridges. In the final story, "Afterworld," girls from a Jewish orphanage who were murdered by Nazis survive decades later as ghosts in the visionary epileptic seizures of the one girl who survived them. If memories in these tales are like the Yangtze River town in "Village 113," threatened with the forced forgetfulness of a man-made flood, they are also like the legendary sturgeon in "The River Nemunas," which surfaces with an ancient, armor-covered dignity years after it was thought to have vanished. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><br> <br> <p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Anthony Doerr</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The title story in your collection grew out of an assignment from <em>McSweeney's</em> to "travel somewhere in the world and imagine life there in 2024" (as part of this special issue). I loved how your story dealt with the near future, with just a few small but fantastic details that seem like they could something of our time. How did you like writing fiction to an assignment like that?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> I loved it. It gave me permission to take a risk I had wanted to take, but worried I couldn&#x2019;t pull off: namely, the idea that someone's memories could someday be harvested, stored, and traded. A couple of years ago, I reviewed a book for the <em>Boston Globe</em> called <em>What We Believe but Cannot Prove</em> in which a neuroscientist named Terrence Sejnowski speculates that someday soon we might be able to locate specific memories in the "extracellular machinery" of our heads and stain them. I had been fascinated by that idea for months, primarily because it reminded me of hunting fossils: looking for one record in a world that generally does not allow such records. I had simultaneously been writing some (lousy) essays about my own memories of my grandmother's descent into dementia. It wasn't until <em>McSweeney's</em> came calling that I gave myself permission to try to braid together a story all these enthusiasms: Alzheimer's and grandma and fossils and South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> South Africa isn't the only far-flung place you write about in this book, much like your previous collection, <em>The Shell Collector</em>: you also set stories in China, Korea, Germany, and Estonia (and, yes, Wyoming). Do you always have to visit a place to imagine a story there, and to imagine the memories its inhabitants might hold?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> Not always. Sometimes a place can be so real, so brimming-over with color and noise and detail, that trying to figure out which details to select for a piece of fiction can be overwhelming. Ultimately I'm trying to write stories inside which a reader is transported; I want readers to have an experience that allows them to enter the time and place and life of someone else. And I want that experience of empathy to be continuous; I don't want the dream of the fiction to be broken by any carelessness on my part. That's the most I can hope for: that a reader might leave his or her world for an hour or two and enter the world of one of my characters. And if a reader is going to be nice enough to read one of my stories, it's up to me to make that world as convincing and seamless as possible. So, certainly, travel can help bring a place to life: its smells, its skies, its birds, its light. In the best case scenario, I start a story set somewhere I have visited previously, and then, once the story is mostly drafted, I return to the place to harvest whatever last details I can find.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Many of your stories are about very private and personal experiences of some of our most public and collective dramas: the Holocaust, the aftermath of apartheid, the flooding of the Yangtze. Is that gap between public and private memory one of the engines for your fiction?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> Yes, yes, yes. We tend to believe history is about collective memory, about voiceovers and textbooks and pop quizzes, but for me history is about individuals. The glory and genius of <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em>, for example, is in the ordinary, quotidian day-to-day detailing of the writing: the things they eat, the jokes they tell. The horror comes through because of the mundanity. I read that book when I was fourteen, the same age as Anne, and the lessons of that little diary have stayed with me: first, that through books, the memories of the dead can live; and second, that the path to the universal is through the individual. Only through the smallest details, through the sights and smells and sounds of one person's moment-by-moment experience, can a writer convey the immensity that is a human life.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Publishers don't quite know what to do with novellas, but many of my very favorite stories fall into that in-between length. What do you like about working within its boundaries? Are there novellas you love? Perhaps the great novella of the English language, Joyce's "The Dead," is also one of the great memory tales. Is there something about that size that suits storytelling about memory?</p> <p><strong>Doerr:</strong> I love long stories and novellas. They can manage to be bigger than slice-of-life short stories, stories that compress or truncate lives as so many contemporary short stories tend to. In a novella you can work with bigger scales, with a character's birth and death, and with his or her memories. And, yet, because of their relative brevity, because a reader can read a novella in a single day, on a single airplane flight, they can often be more intense, more involving, and more shattering than novels. <br><br>That said, you&#x2019;re right, writing them can be scary, because only a very brave publisher is going to produce a book that's less than 150 pages long, and only a very brave magazine is going to run a story longer than 30 pages. So as a writer you feel yourself plunge off a small cliff when you hit about 10,000 words and realize you have 10,000 to go.&nbsp; <br><br>At first you might be scared, anyway, but soon afterward there's a certain release. You think: This thing I'm making is not going to sell for a pile of money, this is not my Big Novel; it's just a novella, and I'm going to take whatever risks I want to with it.&nbsp; <br><br>I'm actually very interested in how e-readers like the Kindle are going to change the way writers work and readers read. Theoretically, it could be much easier for a publishing house to take a chance on a novella if they don't have to pay for the production costs. Who knows, maybe short stories and novellas are tailor-made for the electronic medium?<br><br>Novellas I love? My absolute favorite is Katherine Anne Porter's "Pale Horse, Pale Rider" (though, interestingly, in her introduction to her collected stories, Porter insists that "Pale Horse, Pale Rider" be called a "long story"). And of course Tolstoy's<em> The Death of Ivan Ilych</em>, which everyone should read once every ten years.&nbsp; And of course, "The Dead", as you mentioned. As for living writers, I love Andrea Barrett's "Ship Fever" and "Servants of the Map" and a little known one by Denis Johnson called "Train Dreams" that I encountered in the <em>2003 O. Henry Prize Stories</em>.<br></p> <br> <br>Anthony Doerr is the author of three books, The Shell Collector, About Grace, and Four Seasons in Rome. Doerr&#39;s short fiction has won three O.

Nearly all of his books have been in print internationally since his death in 1969, and his writing has been discovered and enjoyed by new readers throughout the world. Kerouac's view of the promise of America, the seductive and lovely vision of the beckoning open spaces of our continent, has never been expressed better by subsequent writers, perhaps because Kerouac was our last writer to believe in America's promise--and essential innocence--as the legacy he would explore in his autobiographical fiction.</p></p><p><p><b>Ann Charters</b> received her B.A. at Berkeley and her Ph.D. at Columbia.

The fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 was a blow to Christendom from which it has never really recovered. That glorious city&#x2014;home to the Byzantine Empire for more than a thousand years and to Hagia Sophia (Church of the Holy Wisdom), Christendom&#x2019;s most famous church&#x2014;lay in ruins, its emperor dead and its people slain or taken prisoner. When news of the sacking reached Europe, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who would become Pope Pius II a few years later, described the fall of the city as &#x201c;the loss of one of the two eyes of the church&#x201d;&#x2014;the other being Rome.1<br> <br>Constantinople had been a major stopping place for pilgrims en route to Jerusalem, primarily because it was the repository for a number of holy relics. Pilgrims yearned for a glimpse of objects like pieces of the True Cross; the remains of Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary; and the bones of Saint Luke, brought back from Jerusalem by Helena, the mother of Constantine I, the founder and first emperor of the eponymous city. Helena, who had made pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 326, had also found the location where Jesus had been buried and had ordered a church, the Holy Sepulchre, to be built on the site.<br> <br>In addition to its religious heritage, Constantinople was also home to European merchants, especially the Genoese who had come to dominate trade with the East through its outposts at ports on the Black Sea. Now, in the mid-fifteenth century, with the fall of Constantinople, the trade route to the East and the pilgrimage route to Jerusalem was virtually closed to the West. Constantinople, like Jerusalem, was in the hands of Muslims. In the struggle between Christianity and Islam, Islam seemed to be winning. Many Christians read this as a sign the end of the world was fast approaching. A pall settled over Europe.<br> <br>The Ottomans, however, were jubilant; they had finally captured the <i>&#x201c;Kizil Elma&#x201d;</i> (Red or Golden Apple) of their dreams.2 Although Muslims had been sweeping across Asia Minor for some time, the Ottomans, known among themselves as <i>ghazis</i> or holy warriors, had pushed the farthest. By 1326, they had reached the Sea of Marmara across which they could almost see Constantinople. They lusted after that prize not only because of its opulent buildings, its luxury and learning, and its symbolic importance, but also because of its strategic position.<br> <br><br> <br>Strategic location of Constantinople. <i>Map prepared by Lynn Carlson, GISP.</i><br> <br>Constantinople, today&#x2019;s Istanbul, is situated on hills that overlook the place where three waterways meet: the Sea of Marmara, which flows through the Dardanelles out to the Aegean; the Golden Horn, an inlet off the Marmara that divides the city; and the Bosphorus, a strait that leads up from the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea. Thus, whoever controlled Constantinople controlled travel and trade from ports in the Black Sea to those in the Mediterranean and beyond. Although the Byzantine Empire had contracted considerably over the years to contain barely more than the city itself, Constantinople was thought to be impregnable. It was protected by miles of stone walls that were fifteen feet thick and more than forty feet high, with evenly dispersed towers that were twice as high. There were three sets of walls in all, one inside the other, each separated by a fosse or moat. These fortifications would be put to the test. Ottomans had tried several times to take the city, but had been unsuccessful. They had kept sight of their goal, however, and had made long-term plans; in preparation for the siege of Constantinople, they had conquered a huge swath of territory in Europe: from Gallipoli to Adrianople, from Varna on the Black Sea, to Greece, and then to Kosovo and Bosnia, across the Adriatic from Italy, until Constantinople was effectively surrounded.<br> <br>The ambitious young sultan known as Mehmet II decided that the &#x201c;Apple&#x201d; was finally ripe for the plucking. Late in 1452, he took his army of more than eighty thousand soldiers and marched from his capital in Adrianople toward Constantinople. He quartered his troops at Rumeli Hisar&#x131;, a fortress his workmen had quickly constructed on the shores of the Bosphorus, a few miles north of the city walls. Rumeli Hisar&#x131;, or &#x201c;Roman fortress,&#x201d; was built at the narrowest point on the Bosphorus, known as Bo&#x11f;azkesen (throat-cutter), directly across from the Anadolu Hisar&#x131;, the Anatolian fortress, built by his great-grandfather Beyazit I. From these two forts, the Ottomans could seize any ships coming from the Black Sea, collecting tariffs or confiscating their goods and capturing their crews. By the beginning of 1453 they were ready to begin the siege.<br> <br>In the Ottoman camps, the fires burned all night and the men were whipped into fighting mood by the beat of drums, the shrill high notes of the <i>zurna,</i> and shouting songs that made it difficult for people inside the city to sleep. They also set up their cannons and began an incessant bombardment of the walls in a strategy of &#x201c;shock and awe.&#x201d;<br> <br>The noise and vibration of the massed guns, the clouds of smoke, the shattering impact of stone on stone dismayed seasoned defenders. To the civilian population it was a glimpse of the coming apocalypse and a retribution for sin . . . [it was] according to one Ottoman chronicler, &#x201c;like the awful resurrection blast.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Seeing all this activity, the Byzantines inside the city became terrified; Emperor Constantine XI wrote a desperate letter to Pope Nicholas V, promising to unify the Eastern Orthodox and Western Catholic churches if he would quickly send reinforcements. Although both Catholic and Orthodox were nominally Christian, their enmity was of long standing, ever since the two branches of the Church had split in the eleventh century. &#x201c;Unity,&#x201d; however, would not mean equality between the two branches, but submission of the Orthodox church to the primacy of Rome. Many Byzantines felt that was too high a price to pay for Rome&#x2019;s support, but they were vastly outnumbered. Although the population of the city was about forty thousand, they could count at most five thousand Greek men available to fight. To be sure, there were also about two thousand foreigners&#x2014;some Venetians and Florentines, but mostly Genoese who lived in Galata across the Golden Horn from the Greek part of the city&#x2014;but their loyalty could not be assumed since they were Latin Christians, not Orthodox Christians like the Greeks.<br> <br>Nevertheless, according to a letter written to the pope by Archbishop Leonard, who had been called from Chios to help negotiate the union, the emperor and his senate had agreed to the union and it was apparently confirmed in mid-December 1452.4 For a short time hostilities thawed somewhat, if not among priests and theologians, at least among the people imperiled in the city. They celebrated when a Genoese ship arrived in January 1453 filled with food, supplies, and seven hundred soldiers&#x2014;four hundred from Genoa and three hundred from their colony in Chios, an island in the Aegean. Their arrival provided a much-needed boost to morale to those in the city, especially when they learned that one of the Chian soldiers was Giovanni Giustiniani, who knew how to fortify and repair damaged walls. Knowing that his skill would be essential during the impending siege, Constantine XI, the Byzantine emperor, quickly made him his second-in-command. Some of the Genoese in Galata rushed to join and fight alongside Giustiniani, while others rushed to the ship, hoping to catch passage back to Genoa. But the majority of the Genoese in Constantinople did not want to lose the lucrative trade from their Black Sea colony at Caffa in the Crimea. Luciano Spinola, one of the leading merchants, convinced them to remain neutral in the hope that the Ottomans, like the Byzantines, would appreciate the luxury goods such as caviar and sturgeon that they supplied from that trade.<br> <br>Spring came; the storks returned from their winter sojourn in Africa, and the scent of roses filled the air and the churches. But these joyful signs could not dispel the unease felt by the people trapped inside the city. To add to their anxiety, at the beginning of April, Easter Week, a couple of small earthquakes rattled their already frayed nerves. For weeks, Mehmet&#x2019;s soldiers had provoked small skirmishes along the length of the walls as a way to tire the Christians before the onslaught. For a time, the Christians had the advantage, despite their numbers. Ottoman cannon fire had damaged but not destroyed the walls, and when the soldiers tried to scale them, the Christians could knock them down with stones. Still, the continual assault and the constant vigilance had exhausted them.<br> <br>As an alternative strategy to breaching the walls, the Ottomans began to dig tunnels under them. The Byzantines soon discovered some of the tunnels and set fire to them, capturing soldiers and forcing them to give the locations of other tunnels. They were also aware that there were two vulnerable places along the land walls&#x2014;one at the St. Romanus Gate, located in a depression caused by the Lycus River, and the other at a point where the walls met at right angles, behind the Blachernae Palace. The Ottomans decided to focus on the St. Romanus Gate because the depression rendered the towers lower than hills opposite and also because the riverbed had made it difficult to construct a deep moat. Immediately, they moved their monster cannon into place. It was twenty-seven feet long&#x2014;probably the largest cannon ever constructed at the time&#x2014;and could lob a stone cannonball weighing a thousand pounds against the wall or over it. Never had anything like it been seen. It demolished part of the wall, but at night Giustiniani and his helpers were able to repair it and the assault continued.<br> <br>Near the Golden Horn, the Ottoman fleet was similarly stalled. Aware that their city was most vulnerable through the Golden Horn, the Byzantines had laid a huge chain boom, designed, in fact, by a Genoese, across its entrance to prevent Ottoman ships from entering and attacking both sides of the city. That was a clever strategy but hardly a panacea; they desperately needed more soldiers and supplies from Europe.<br> <br>The pope in Rome had dawdled in sending aid. He had assumed the city was well fortified and couldn&#x2019;t believe God would let it go to the infidels, and he was waiting for assurance that a &#x201c;union&#x201d; between the Greek and Roman churches would be consummated before he sent aid. At the end of March, the pope finally dispatched three Genoese ships, but they got caught in a storm near Chios and did not reach Constantinople until April 20, when they confronted a fleet of Ottoman ships and triremes. Those on land, including Constantine and Mehmet, could only watch as a vicious battle ensued. Against the odds, the Genoese sailors managed to fight off the Ottoman ships and slip through the boom that was opened for them, into the Golden Horn, where they unloaded much-needed supplies.5 This success of the Genoese greatly embarrassed Mehmet II. In response, he devised an ingenious way to circumvent the boom.<br> <br>In the dead of night, on April 22, the Ottomans carried out one of the most amazing military maneuvers of the time, perhaps of all time. On greased logs they rolled seventy-two ships overland up from the Bosphorus, over the hill of Galata, and down into the Golden Horn inside the boom, from where they could easily barrage the city. When the Christians awoke and saw this, they must have felt they were doomed. Yet, miraculously, they would continue to hold the Ottomans at bay for another month.<br> <br>On the twelfth of May, the Ottoman forces came against the palace walls with thousands of soldiers and, according to Nicol� Barbaro, an eyewitness, &#x201c;these Turkish dogs&#x201d; let loose with &#x201c;fierce cries according to their custom, and with sounds of castanets and tambourines . . . they made a strong attack against the walls of the palace, so that the majority of those in the city thought that night that the city was lost.&#x201d;6 Yet the Christians clung to their belief that God would not allow the city to fall to the &#x201c;wicked pagans,&#x201d; at least not until a prophecy, attributed to the first Constantine, was fulfilled. He had prophesied that the city would never fall until the &#x201c;moon rose darkened,&#x201d; and since that had not yet occurred the people inside the city continued hopeful.<br> <br>Two weeks later, however, their hope ran out. On May 24, there was a lunar eclipse, followed by torrential rain, fog, and a strange light that hovered over Hagia Sophia. Among the terrified citizens a rumor spread that &#x201c;the time of the Antichrist had arrived,&#x201d; meaning that the end of the world was nigh. In the Bible, the Antichrist is identified as a powerful leader who will come in the last days to tempt people away from their faith.7 A huge battle will ensue, the Antichrist will be defeated. Christ will come again to judge both the quick and the dead, and the world will end. For the people in Constantinople, it was easy to imagine that Mehmet was the Antichrist and that the end-time was upon them.<br> <br>At this crucial moment, Mehmet tempted Emperor Constantine with terms of surrender. Constantine refused, and summoning the people to Hagia Sophia, he warned them that the great battle for the fate of the world was imminent. He told them that they should be ready to die for their faith, their country, their family, and their sovereign. Encouraged by his words, Greek and Latin Christians united against their common enemy, the Muslims. After taking communion together, the men went back to their posts, and the women carried water to refresh them and collected stones for them to rain down upon the enemy.<br> <br>On the night of May 28, after fifty-four days of continual siege, the Ottoman camp was deathly quiet. The Greeks hoped against hope that the Ottomans had given up. But at dawn, when the sun was shining directly into the Christians&#x2019; eyes, the elite Janissary corps8 of the Ottoman forces stormed the walls and a ferocious battle ensued. Still, the Christians held on. When the emperor saw that his commander-in-chief was missing, he &#x201c;went in great distress to see where he had gone&#x201d; and learned that Giustiniani had been wounded by an arrow and had left his post on the ramparts. When he found him, he pleaded, &#x201c;I beg you; your flight will encourage others to do the same. Your wound is not mortal; bear the pain and stay at your post like a man, as you promised to do.&#x201d; But Giustiniani fled, and &#x201c;as he fled, he went through the city crying &#x2018;the Turks have got into the city!&#x2019;&#x201d;9 Hearing this, many of the people panicked and abandoned their posts to follow him, hoping to escape on the ships. Many later believed that had he remained, their city might not have been lost. Constantine and his men continued fighting bravely. It is said that the emperor, proclaiming he would rather die fighting for his city than live among the infidels, dismounted his horse and joined the fray. He was last seen, sword in hand, disappearing into the crowd. Not long after his disappearance, the wall was breached. Ottoman soldiers swarmed in and soon their banner flew from the ramparts. The city had fallen to the Muslims. The date was May 29, 1453.<br> <br>Later in the day, Sultan Mehmet, forever after known as &#x201c;the Conquerer,&#x201d; rode directly to Hagia Sophia ...</p><h2>Peter Tchaikovsky (Getting to Know the World&#39;s Greatest Artists)</h2><p>Presents a biography of the nineteenth-century Russian composer who created such ballets as Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker</p><p>Mike Venezia is the author of several nonfiction books for children.<p>Gr 2-4--In these two cheerful books, Venezia takes the same approach he used in ``Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists'' series (Childrens).

It was gorgeous and unfamiliar and deeply fascinating. Unfortunately, I stayed there for ten days. There are a lot of insects in the Amazon, a lot of mud, surprisingly few vegetables, too many snakes. You can&#x2019;t go anywhere by yourself, which makes sense if you don&#x2019;t know the terrain, but I enjoy going places by myself.

Yes, you were writing a novel about the Amazon, and then you decided not to write a novel about the Amazon, and then I started writing a novel about the Amazon, and later when we compared notes (your book dismissed, mine halfway finished) they had remarkably similar story lines, to the point of being eerie. I thought this must be because it was an incredibly banal idea and we had both come up with a generic Amazon novel, but then you told me that ideas fly around looking for homes, and when the idea hadn&#x2019;t worked out with you it came to me. If this is true I think your name should be on the cover.

I had very little experience with opera when I wrote <em>Bel Canto</em>, and since then it&#x2019;s become a huge part of my life. It was fun to write a scene set at the opera now that I know what I&#x2019;m talking about.</p> <p><strong> EG:</strong><em> State of Wonder</em> a rollicking adventure story, full of peril and bravery and death-defying action. I personally know you to be a homebody who likes to bake muffins for neighbors. How the heck did you pull off this wildness so convincingly? Was it as invigorating to write as it is to read?</p> <p><strong>AP:</strong> Ah, the life of the mind. All the adventure I need I can dream up in my kitchen. I love writing outside of my own experience, making imaginary worlds. If I wrote novels based on my own life I would not be making a living at this. I also love to write a strong plot. I want things to happen in my books, I want to be thrilled. I always think about Raymond Chandler. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m getting the phrasing wrong but the general idea is that when things get slow, bring in a man with a gun.

Tell us how you managed such a miracle?</p> <p><strong> AP:</strong> When I first started writing this book, I came downstairs one night and found my husband listening to &#x201c;Horowitz at Carnegie Hall&#x201d;. The album cover has a very lush filigreed border. I had two thoughts: first, I have an amazing husband who thankfully held onto his Horowitz LPs; second, that the album cover had the exact the feeling I wanted for my book--half jungle, half Baroque period.

Whether male or female, you will likely reach a similar conclusion: It is a book for the ages, to be treasured and studied and taken to heart.</p><p>Charles William Daniel (1871-1955) was a maverick free-thinker whose tiny publishing house had august links with many of the most influential thinkers and movements of the 20th century. To wit, copies of Daniel&#39;s books could be found in the library at Ghandi&#39;s ashram. This spirit lived on after his death, and the company maintained its niche by publishing definitive texts on a variety of spiritual and esoteric subjects. Many of these titles, notably those on Aromatherapy and Bach Flower remedies, have become standard works on the subject. When the C.W. Daniel list went looking for a new home, the Vermilion and Rider imprints were the natural place for this wonderful collection of authors.Florence Scovel Shinn carried out her work in the first half of the 20th century.

But how has this most essential experience changed over time and cultures? What is the history of maternity&#x2015;the history of pregnancy, birth, the encounter with an infant? Can one capture the historical trail of mothers? How?</p><p>In <i>Mother Is a Verb</i>, the historian Sarah Knott creates a genre all her own in order to craft a new kind of historical interpretation. Blending memoir and history and building from anecdote, her book brings the past and the present viscerally alive. It is at once intimate and expansive, lyrical and precise.</p><p>As a history, <i>Mother Is a Verb</i> draws on the terrain of Britain and North America from the seventeenth century to the close of the twentieth. Knott searches among a range of past societies, from those of Cree and Ojibwe women to tenant farmers in Appalachia; from enslaved people on South Carolina rice plantations to tenement dwellers in New York City and London&#x2019;s East End. She pores over diaries, letters, court records, medical manuals, items of clothing. And she explores and documents her own experiences.</p><p>As a memoir, <i>Mother Is a Verb</i> becomes a method of asking new questions and probing lost pasts in order to historicize the smallest, even the most mundane of human experiences. Is there a history to interruption, to the sound of an infant&#x2019;s cry, to sleeplessness? Knott finds answers not through the telling of grand narratives, but through the painstaking accumulation of a trellis of anecdotes. And all the while, we can feel the child on her hip.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Knott</b> grew up in England. Educated at Oxford University, she is now a professor of history at Indiana University. She is the author of <i>Sensibility and the American Revolution</i> and numerous articles on the histories of women, gender, and emotion. Knott has served as an editor of the<i> American Historical Review</i>, the American Historical Association&#x2019;s flagship journal, and sits on the editorial board of <i>Past and Present</i>. She is a fellow of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction.<p>"The book is a joy to read, borne of raw curiosity and intelligence, nurtured into the world to fill a gap in understanding . . . [an] excellent tribute to the past, complete with dispatches from her very raw, real postpartum present." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p>"By starting with the link between mother and baby, and crawling outward into the link between so many mothers, [Knott] shows that while infancy is a time when life is measured in days, in its curves are centuries." &#x2015;<i>Time</i></p><p>&#x201c;Heartfelt and original . . . Intensely written . . . Every mother-to-be should read it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sunday Times</i> (London)</p><p>&#x201c;An exploration of mothering, a capacious, complex, and creative experience. Historian and mother of two, Knott grounds her illuminating investigation in her own experience of pregnancy . . . A fresh, lively narrative of personal and historical memory.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;The last book of similar intellectual heft to make me cry toppled from a bookshelf on to my foot.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Spectator</i> (UK) </p><p>&#x201c;Knott's novel approach, companionable tone, and sidesteps into memoir of mothering her own babies give the book a sense of freedom; sharing her joy or delirium, she shifts naturally into intimate, poet's prose . . . Hers is a deliberate and altogether radical effort in making the unseen sensational, and the mundane anything but.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;Original and important . . . Powerfully conveys the thrilling, bewildering, and fuzzy-headed atmosphere that surrounds pregnancy and childbirth.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Herald </i>(Scotland) </p><p>&#x201c;The last couple of years have been marked by an explosion of writing about motherhood in memoir and fiction. The early moments recorded by Knott can be found in Jessie Greengrass, in Rivka Galchen; going further back, there&#x2019;s Maggie Nelson, further still, Rachel Cusk. What Knott adds to this is less her own experience, though it&#x2019;s beautifully recorded, than the wider perspective that allows her to say with authority that mothering has always been intimately connected with other aspects of our economic and social lives.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Guardian</i>; A <i>Guardian</i> Book of the Day</p><p>&#x201c;This lyrical book&#x2015;one-third memoir, two-thirds history&#x2015;guides us through centuries of pregnancy, childbirth, and infant care. Sarah Knott stitches her personal story to vignettes from the past and shows us how everyday mothering differed in time and place. With stunning prose, she gives us the sensory shorn of the sentimental. A riveting read.&#x201d; &#x2015;Joanne Meyerowitz, Yale University</p><p>&#x201c;In this innovative, grippingly readable history, Sarah Knott has woven a scintillating tapestry of ideas and experiences across time. <i>Mother Is a Verb </i>is a moving and enlightening meditation on the most elemental, yet ceaselessly varied, of all human bonds.&#x201d; &#x2015;Faramerz Dabhoiwala, author of <i>The Origins of Sex</i></p><p>&#x201c;The union of memoir and history comes of age. Sarah Knott weaves an intimate account of becoming a mother into a richly documented history of maternity. This is a book to savor and share with anyone who loves great history writing.&#x201d; &#x2015;Barbara Taylor, Professor of Humanities at the University of London and author of <i>Eve and the New Jerusalem</i> and <i>The Last Asylum</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this beautifully written book, Sarah Knott speaks from the vantage point of a mother and a historian. Full of stories ranging across time, space, and ethnicity, with imagery that touches all our senses, <i>Mother Is a Verb</i> captures the physicality and emotions of motherhood so that even those of us who have never experienced it ourselves feel what it is like to get pregnant, give birth, and raise a child.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nancy Shoemaker, Professor of History at the University of Connecticut and author of <i>A Strange Likeness</i></p><p>&#x201c;This fabulous book manages both to re-create what those extraordinary early months of motherhood are like and to make sense of them by placing them in history. Sarah Knott&#x2019;s diary of motherhood is poetic: she conveys the sense that time has stopped, that only the baby&#x2019;s reflux matters, the heightened power of smell, the loss of self. The historical anecdotes Knott provides are riveting, and open up new ways of understanding what motherhood can be. This is a new kind of history writing. A truly original, inspiring book.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lyndal Roper, Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford and author of <i>Martin Luther</i></p></p><h2>By Right of Conquest (Works of G.

Produced by Barbra Streisand and Cis Corman, the October film features actresses Elizabeth Perkins and Sela Ward as single women who acted alone to save Jewish lives.A welcome addition to Holocaust literature, this work presents a series of 49 personal reminiscences of non-Jewish citizens in various European nations who risked their lives to hide resident Jews from the Nazi horror. Most of those interviewed felt their actions were done out of friendship and for people caught in a web of hatred and anti-Semitism. They did not feel that they were acting heroically but that they were doing what was right. Portraits by Block of each of the rescuers accompany the text. These 49 are representative of the 9,295 rescuers honored at the Yad Vashem in Israel.

Maybe you feel that you're at a roadblock. You want to be someone else, someone happier, fitter, healthier, stronger. But just <i>wishing</i> for change is not enough; you have to take the first step. You have to find the power within you that will move you in the direction you want to go.</p><p>If you want your life to change from the course it is on, you must be willing to change. Not the circumstances, not someone else, not your parents or your spouse or your boss. It may be a word, an exercise, or an affirmation; all you need is a spark, something that will make you think differently than you have before. Somewhere in this book you will find something that will change your life.</p><p>Principle 1 of the IntenSati Method is that as soon as you make the decision to change, your life will follow. It has to. You are the one directing it. You are doing it every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every year till death do you part. <i>That</i> is power! To change physically, you have to be willing to change the way you think, feel, and act. The thoughts you are thinking, whether you are paying attention to them or not, are activating emotions within you. Those emotions fuel your energy, and that energy fuels your actions. IntenSati is the practice of keeping your attention on your thoughts, guiding them and your self-talk <i>deliberately</i> to activate emotions that will empower you instead of disempower you. It will enable you to live a life in which you are appreciating, loving, creating, and caring, instead of complaining and worrying most of the time.</p><p>Now, usually, when we know we need to change something, we think about the actions we're going to change. "I'm going to start going to the gym three times a week to get rid of this tummy!" we'll say, or "I'm going to start cooking healthier meals and reduce my calorie count," in the hope that these actions will turn us into thinner, happier people. It's a nice plan, but how many times have you started a new program only to find yourself in the same place a few weeks, a few months, or a few years later? It takes an extraordinary amount of mindfulness and desire to take inspired action. Your success starts well before the trip to the grocery store or your first jog around the block. Before you do anything, you have to pay attention to what is inspiring your actions (or your lack of them). You have to take control of your thoughts and mind and first understand the person you <i>really</i> are and the power you have to ignite powerful, positive, loving emotions.</p><p>You Are the Thinker, Not the Thought</p><p>If you have been hating yourself, loathing your body, or criticizing your lack of willpower and courage to change, it is precisely that inner conversation that is holding you back. It's robbing you of your power. Think of every thought you have not as an observation, but as a command. Most of us don't even notice or question the thoughts we have. But the fact is, you are what you think about all day long.</p><p>If you have the belief that you cannot lose weight, that no matter what you do you will fail, then guess what? You will fail. If you feel that weight on your body is stubborn and will never go away, then it will obey. Why? It is not the condition that is stubborn. You are stubbornly holding a thought that is keeping that condition in place. Think about how you speak about your body and what you tell your friends and family. Do you say things like:</p><blockquote><i>* "It's impossible for me to lose weight."<br>* "No matter what I do, I can't stick to a diet."<br>* "I hate exercise and I can't find something I like to do."<br>* "I am lazy. I have no willpower."<br>* "I give up! Diets don't work for me."</i></blockquote><p>Now look back at those words not as observations, but as commands. You are the one in charge. Why can't you lose weight, stick to a diet, or find a workout that works? Because <i>you</i> have been telling yourself -- and probably anyone who will listen -- how powerless, helpless, and hopeless you are. And so it is!</p><p>Let Your Heart Be Your Guide</p><p>You can change your life. No matter how far you think you've gone astray, you can get back on track starting <i>this moment.</i> First, you need to start paying attention to your thoughts. Will you make a commitment to yourself and catch yourself when you feel that negative feeling bubbling? Use those nagging, needling words that pop into your head and your heart as your red flag. Let them guide you to get back on track. When you hear them or feel them creeping up on you, stop, refocus, and choose to replace them with something more powerful and constructive. If you do this, you will begin to see yourself differently. Other people will see you differently. You will begin to wake up to a whole new world of possibilities.</p><p>Try this exercise. What if, instead of those negative things you tell yourself day after day, you try verbalizing the following thoughts instead? Say them out loud, whisper them, write them, feel them, imagine them as your truth. When one feels particularly good to you, use it. If it brings up a positive emotion, summon it like a prayer, repeating it over and over. Feel it create a change of focus within you. It's like turning on a light switch! When you turn on the light, all the dark disappears. This is the beginning of creating a new script for the New You. When you have a new script, you will have a new life.</p><p>As you read the lines below, take a few moments to imagine what powerful actions would follow these powerful statements of responsibility. This is the beginning...</p><blockquote><i>* "I can change now; I am ready."<br>* "I choose to believe I can do this."<br>* "I want this, and with practice I can do anything."<br>* "What I think about I bring about."<br>* "Today I am keeping my attention on my happiness and my health."<br>* "I am powerful now, and I am accepting it."<br>* "I take full responsibility for my body today."<br>* "I care about how I feel, and I am ready to feel great."</i></blockquote><p>Mind/Body Exercise: Begining the Practice</p><p>To open the IntenSati practice, we begin with a powerful warm-up for both your body and your mind:<i></i></p><blockquote><p><i>"Every day in a very true way I co???create my reality. As above, so below. This is what I know."</i></p></blockquote><p>As you have learned in this chapter, every day you are creating our experience by the thoughts you choose to think, the perspective you choose to take, the attention you give to what you hate or what you love...or anything in between. You are always creating because you are always thinking.</p><p>Here is the important thing about your part in the co???creation process: You may not always have a say in your circumstances, but you always have a say in your <i>perspective</i> of the circumstances. You were born to the parents you were born to; you are as tall as you are going to be; you have a past you cannot change; you have the challenges you face. But either you can use those circumstances as proof of why you cannot be who you want to be, or you can see them as a starting point and go from there -- you participate in the reality your life becomes. By choosing to accept where you are right now and dropping the complaining about it, you will create the opening for a new possibility, a new outcome, a new result!</p><p>The Sati life is a conscious, deliberate life. It's about loving, thriving, and taking the reins. Do this warm-up every day for thirty days. Write it down on a notecard and place it in many places that you can see throughout the day. Memorize it, say it over and over to yourself as you go about your day. Make it an imprint on your mind and your heart that you are the one responsible for your health and happiness. It takes just two minutes, and if you start every day with this declaration, you will awaken yourself to who you really are. No longer will you see yourself as powerless, unworthy, or unable. Instead, you will begin to see that great things are within your grasp.</p><blockquote><b>Before you begin, stand in the ready pose, hands at your heart, eyes closed, and repeat to yourself your intention: "I intend to feel good" or "I intend to feel better." You are warming up your body and your mind together. Once you learn the entire exercise outlined here, do it for at least two minutes. You are harnessing your power of concentration. Even though you may feel that you are "just thinking it," try not to let your mind wander.</b></blockquote><p><b>Ready:</b> Stand tall, your eyes straight ahead, feet together, and shoulders back, with your arms by your sides.

Their applications provided intimate testimony concerning their own lives, accounts of their parents' sexual relationships, and details regarding the impact of illegitimacy within their families and communities. Bourbon officials in Spain debated which petitions merited approval, and in the process forged policies concerning gender, sexuality, illegitimacy, and the family. Scattered throughout the Archive of the Indies, the petitions were difficult to locate until the author determined the pattern of how they were archived and was able to access this extraordinarily rich new source for Spanish American social history. For this book, she has not only analyzed the <i>gracias al sacar</i> documents of some 240 illegitimates, but also traced the histories of those involved in eighteen major archives in Spain, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. The collective biographies of the <i>gracias al sacar</i> parents, and of their illegitimate offspring&#x2015;as infants, children, and adults&#x2015;reveal a Hispanic mentality that consciously differentiated between the public and private spheres. Colonial elites distinguished between a private circle of family, kin, and intimate friends and a public world where status (<i>honor</i>) was negotiated with outside peers. This bifurcation was distinct yet permeable; an individual might "pass" to negotiate a public status different from a private reality. Thus, an unwed mother might enjoy the public reputation that she was a virgin, the bastard son of a priest might be treated as legitimate, and a mulatto could be transformed into someone white. The author explores how the probability for passing varied throughout the Spanish Empire, and how it narrowed as the eighteenth century drew to a close. She also demonstrates that the inability to conceptualize passing beyond the scope of the individual exacerbated social tensions prior to independence.</p><p>&#x201c;Beautifully written, capaciously documented, and compellingly argued, this book contributes enormously to the colonial Spanish-American historiography on race, social status, and culture, as well as on how these themes were played out in daily life as concerns for honor, gender, and sexuality.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ram�n Gutierrez, University of California, San Diego<br>&#x201c;Fresh, well written, thoroughly documented, and extraordinarily informative, this outstanding social history is one of the most important works in colonial Spanish American history published in the 1990s.&#x201d;&#x2014;ChoiceAnn Twinam is Professor of History at the University of Cincinnati.</p><h2>400 Questions and Answers About the Life and Times of Jesus Christ</h2><p>In this engaging volume, renowned gospel scholar and teacher Susan Easton Black explores more than 400 questions many inspired by her own students about the life and times of the Savior. Organized chronologically from the Nativity to the Resurrection, the author&#39;s skillful responses lend valuable insight into the childhood and adolescence of Jesus as well as His mortal ministry and atoning sacrifice. Many of these descriptive passages provide key details regarding New Testament geography, politics, and culture that illuminate and enhance the scriptural text, while others address more complex doctrinal topics in a succinct and sensitive manner. Colorfully illustrated with more than 80 images, this book is an ideal companion for students and teachers in a variety of settings, from Seminary to Gospel Doctrine class to personal and family scripture study. The research in this book is backed by extensive documentation, as well as deep and evident love for the subject matter. Dr. Black provides a fascinating view of the historical and religious identity of Jesus Christ through the lens of the restored gospel.</p><p></p><h2>Notes on Love and Courage</h2><p>Records the author&#39;s personal reflections on unselfishness, love, loyalty, courage, and honesty and the problems of friendship and growth</p><p></p><h2>The Southern Junior League Cookbook</h2><p>An excellent source of traditional Southern favorites, such as: Red Beans and Rice, Fried Chicken, Shrimp Creole, and gumbo.

The woman he'd rammed into was already out of her sporty red mini-SUV and on her hands and knees looking beneath the vehicle.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" Jack swallowed the epithet he'd been about to use. He'd learned to apply politeness regardless of the circumstances.</p> <p>Still entranced with the underside of her car, the woman didn't respond.</p> <p>Standing in the center freeway lane, Jack surveyed the slow-moving traffic on both sides of him. For once, he could appreciate a Silicon Valley rush hour. If they'd been going faster, they wouldn't have made it through the collision without serious injury. Christ. Jack turned to the gold Cadillac that had rear-ended him when he'd slammed on his brakes. The Caddy's driver hadn't moved yet, though his air bag had deflated.</p> <p>Jack ran back. Squatting by the Caddy's closed window, he shouted through the glass. "You okay?"</p> <p>No answer, but at least the old man's eyes were open, though dazed, and he'd turned his head. Jack whipped his cell phone off his belt and punched in emergency.</p> <p>With the call made, he opened the door slowly. The cars in the commute lane to his left moved over to the shoulder, giving him room. He held the man back against the seat when he tried to move. "Just stay put until the ambulance gets here. They need to check you out. Feel like anything's broken?"</p> <p>The old man shook his head, but would he really know? His eyes couldn't seem to focus on Jack's face. At least there wasn't any blood. Jack stood.</p> <p>Then he saw the woman again, the one responsible for the accident. This time her head was under <i>his</i> truck, her butt in the air, short skirt barely covering her essentials. "What are you doing now?"</p> <p>Stalking back, he grabbed her arm and pulled her out. Still on her knees, she stared up at him with the bluest, most freaked-out eyes he'd ever seen.</p> <p>"Didn't you see it?"</p> <p>"See what?" he asked as calmly as possible. She'd started to worry him. He looked for blood on her head, or any sign of trauma.</p> <p>"The body. It fell off the overpass right in front of me. I ran over it."</p> <p>She was young, mid-twenties or so. Blond hair that curled softly over her chest, ocean-blue eyes, a healthy bloom to her cheeks and, from his vantage point as she knelt beside his truck, nice...nice everything.</p> <p>Despite being nuts. "I didn't see a body flying off that overpass, ma'am." Jack struggled to retain that ingrained politeness.</p> <p>She bit her lip, then looked through his legs at the Cadillac. "Maybe it's under there."</p> <p>Jumping up, she tipped sideways on her high heels, leaning dangerously close to the commute lane. Jack reached out to grab her, but she recovered on her own and rushed around him to peer beneath the old man's gold car.</p> <p>She leaned into the open door of the Caddy. "Did you see a man fall off the overpass?"</p> <p>The old man shook his head. He still hadn't spoken, and Jack was anxious about him. The gas fumes and the noise started a pounding in his head. "You could have killed someone slamming on your brakes like that."</p> <p>She sucked in a breath. "Oh, my God, I didn't...are you all right?"</p> <p>"Fine. Thanks for asking." He didn't point out she should have shown the concern before she crawled under his truck.</p> <p>She put a hand on the old guy's shoulder. "What about you?"</p> <p>He smiled up at her blissfully. And nodded. "I'm so sorry. But the body fell right in front of me." Jack closed his eyes and shook his head. "There is no body."</p> <p>She stared at him with guileless eyes. "But I saw it." He didn't know why he was trying to convince her, but he walked to the front of her car, leaned down to look under it, did the same with his own truck&#x2014;aw, Jesus, the crushed bumpers and tailgate made him wince&#x2014;and finally the Cadillac. Then he spread his hands. "Nothing here."</p> <p>Sirens sounded in the distance. Behind them, traffic was stacking up.</p> <p>"Nothing back there, either," he said when she looked at the stream of cars with blinkers on, trying to merge around them.</p> <p>She stared back at the overpass. She'd skidded several feet beyond it. "But I saw it."</p> <p>He cocked his head. She had that odd manic look, overly bright eyes, flushed skin, like a fever, manic fever. He'd seen it on his mother enough times to know. "You have a name, ma'am?"</p> <p>She stared at him for a few too many seconds, and he had the gut feeling she couldn't remember.</p> <p>"Opal," she finally said. "Opal Smith."</p> <p>Ah, thank God, she knew her own name. Nice name, too. "You have insurance, Opal?"</p> <p>"Of course. It's illegal to drive without it." She was still staring up at the bridge, and her lips moved. Over the traffic sounds, he couldn't make out the words.</p> <p>"What'd you say?"</p> <p>"It was a vision."</p> <p>He put his finger in his ear, jiggled it. "Come again?"</p> <p>"I had a vision." She lifted her shoulders and fastened her baby blues on him. "You know. A vision. A premonition."</p> <p>Oh man. She <i>was</i> schizo, a malady with which he'd had far too much experience. Jack looked off down the shoulder lane next to the median where red lights flashed at least a freeway exit away. The ambulance. Or the cops. Another warm June day, but the hot exhaust fumes turned it into mid-August weather. He'd started sweating in his thin T-shirt. Or maybe it was the months of insurance red tape he envisioned. "Don't tell the cops about any <i>visions</i> you had."</p> <p>She tipped her head to the side. "But how am I going to explain about slamming on my brakes?"</p> <p>"Tell them you saw a dog."</p> <p>"Jumping from the overpass?"</p> <p>Jack closed his eyes and took a really deep breath.</p> <p>He'd never bought the old axiom before, but what they said about blondes might be true. The beautiful ultimate proof stared him right in the face, albeit a few inches shorter than his own six-two. "No," he enunciated slowly as if she were deaf. "You tell them it came from the side of the road."</p> <p>"We're in the fast lane. Somebody else would have hit it."</p> <p>He knew he shouldn't have gotten up this morning. Monday. Late for work. The boys at the site were probably sitting on their butts waiting for him to get there. "It was in the median lane, probably got trapped out there, then made a run for it."</p> <p>"But that would be a lie."</p> <p>He could see himself repeating this story months from now over <i>Monday Night Football</i> at Donahoe's, and he actually had to smile. The poor woman needed help, a lot of help. The most he could do for her now was make sure she <i>didn't</i> tell the cops she'd had a vision.</p> <p>"Maybe there really was a dog."</p> <p>"Dogs don't fall out of the sky." Neither did bodies. He'd always considered himself a patient man, but he had his limits. "Have you been drinking?"</p> <p>Her pretty eyes widened with horror. "It isn't even nine o'clock in the morning."</p> <p>"Head start on Happy Hour?"</p> <p>She eye-rolled him.</p> <p>"How about drugs, then?"</p> <p>She gave him a pressed-lip look. Nice red lipstick.</p> <p>"If you tell the cops you had a vision, they're going to test you for every illegal substance known to man."</p> <p>Or, more likely, haul her off to the nearest psych ward. He really did not want to have to call her family to break that news since he knew exactly how it felt. "You have that much time?"</p> <p>She passed a look from the now-crushed rear of her little red SUV, over his double-whammied truck, to the crumpled front of the gold Cadillac, then to the old man still sitting dazed in the front seat. "All right. A dog." She tipped her head again. "Did you see it? Just in case they ask."</p> <p>"I didn't see anything but your rear end." Especially when she was peering under his truck. Now that was a vision.</p> <p>"I HAD A VISION. A REAL ONE." Opal had waited all day for this moment, to make her spectacular revelation.</p> <p>Grandma Blue's head thunked against the scarred Formica tabletop, her fingers clutching spasmodically at the ceramic coffee cup. The last of the sun's rays shone through the kitchen window making the fuschia blossoms on her muumuu glow.</p> <p>"Grandma Blue?" Opal had always thought of her grandmother as, well, ancient, though the older Opal got, the less ancient she seemed. Opal's heart thumped.</p> <p>"Are you all right?"</p> <p>Her grandmother raised her head, her eyes just a little glazed. "No, I'm not all right. I have a daughter who's proclaimed herself 'psychic to the stars," a grandson who appears on TV calling himself a medium and cavorts with dead people and a granddaughter who gives tarot readings. And actually makes a good living at it." Grandma Blue sighed, world-weary. "You were the only normal one."</p> <p>Opal had never considered herself normal, at least not in the context of her family. Even her father, who had died almost thirteen years ago&#x2014;Opal still missed him terribly&#x2014;had a spectacular gift. Blake Smith had been a world-renowned telekinetic, manipulating objects at will. Each member of her family had a special talent. Opal had been waiting all her life to find her own psychic gift. "Will you love me any less if I had an honest-to-God vision?"</p> <p>"Won't love you any less, sweetie pie, but I will be losing the only one of you I had anything in common with."</p> <p>Opal ringed her coffee mug with her index finger. "You know how important this is to me."</p> <p>Grandma Blue heaved an even deeper sigh, her white hair glistening with blue highlights. "Tell me all about it."</p> <p>Excitement exploded all over again inside Opal, and the words burst out. "It was a premonition. I saw a man jump off an overpass on the freeway. But when I got out of the car, he wasn't there. There was nothing there. I looked underneath the car, under the truck that ran into me&#x2014;" She stopped. Oops.</p> <p>"Someone ran into you?" The glaze had left Grandma Blue's eyes completely. She pierced Opal with her see-everything, know-everything gaze.</p> <p>"Yes, well." Opal cleared her throat, then took a gulp of her sweet coffee. "I was on the freeway, you see, and naturally, since I thought what I saw was real, I slammed on the brakes to avoid running the man over, and the guy behind me hit me, and another car hit his truck and..." Her voice trailed off. She felt sixteen instead of twenty-eight, trying to explain how she'd wrecked the family car.</p> <p>If anyone had been hurt in the accident... Opal couldn't bear to think about that. She'd called the hospital to check on the elderly gentleman, and she simply couldn't put words to the relief she'd felt upon hearing he'd been released and was just fine. If he'd been injured, if Jack Davis had been injured, well, her vision would have been a terrible thing. Thank goodness that hadn't happened.</p> <p>"It was just a little fender bender," she added meekly.</p> <p>"How little?" Grandma Blue stared her down.</p> <p>"All right, I had to have the RAV4 towed because there was no way I could drive it, and I won't know for a couple of days how bad the damage is." Then she sat up straight. "But I don't care about the car, if it means I had a psychic vision."</p> <p>Grandma Blue muted the two televisions she had on high volume in the living room. Opal was so used to the background noise, she hadn't even noticed them. Grandma always had two TVs going, one for stock car racing and one for hockey. Since Dale Earnhardt died at Daytona, she was trying to wean herself off the races. Hockey was supposed to do the trick. It hadn't yet. </p> <p>Grandma Blue snorted. "You sound exactly like The Mother when she started that 900 number to do psychic readings."</p> <p>The Mother was Opal's mother. Grandma Blue never called her by her name. In fact, she didn't call Opal's brother Julian by his name, either. The oldest, and the golden child with the weightiest psychic gift, Julian was The Brother.</p> <p>But Opal was getting off track. "I'm not being stubborn, I just want you to be my witness."</p> <p>"I can't be a witness unless someone actually jumps off that overpass." Grandma Blue's fingernails tapped her coffee cup. She stared hard at Opal. "<i>Did</i> someone actually jump?"</p> <p>Opal pushed aside the plate of gooey chocolate chip cookies and gripped Grandma Blue's free hand. "That's the beauty of it. He hasn't jumped yet, and I'm going to save him before he does." She sat back, her face feeling all rosy and hot with triumph.</p></p><h2>Eromenos: A novel of ancient Rome</h2><p>Eros and Thanatos converge in the story of a glorious youth, an untimely death, and an imperial love affair that gives rise to the last pagan god of antiquity. In this coming-of-age novel set in the second century AD, Antinous of Bithynia, a Greek youth from Asia Minor, recounts his seven-year affair with Hadrian, fourteenth emperor of Rome. In a partnership more intimate than Hadrian&#x2019;s sanctioned political marriage to Sabina, Antinous captivates the most powerful ruler on earth both in life and after death. This version of the affair between the emperor and his beloved ephebe vindicates the youth scorned by early Christian church fathers as a &#x201c;shameless and scandalous boy&#x201d; and &#x201c;sordid and loathsome instrument of his master&#x2019;s lust.&#x201d; EROMENOS envisions the personal history of the young man who achieved apotheosis as a pagan god of antiquity, whose cult of worship lasted for hundreds of years&#x2014;far longer than the cult of the emperor Hadrian. In Eromenos, the young man Antinous, whose beautiful image still may be found in art museums around the world, finds a voice of his own at last.</p><p>Melanie McDonald has an MFA in fiction from the University of Arkansas. Her work has appeared in New York Stories, Fugue, Indigenous Fiction, and online. She won a 2008 Hawthornden Fellowship in Scotland for Eromenos.

McDonald has honed her narrative until every phrase glitters. The machinations of other court favorites, the richly-detailed period atmosphere, the wary yet compulsive attraction between the emperor and Antinous all are so richly and intelligently evoked that readers are swept along, forgetting that they already know how this particular story turns out. <i>Eromenos</i> is one of the finest historical novels I've read in many years.

It also shows how countercultural Christianity can provide a needed critique of our self-centered, consumerist society."--<b>Tony Campolo</b>, Eastern University<br><br>"This book is a scavenger hunt into Christian history and the abandoned places of Empire where the Spirit is stirring today.

Indian maps--made on buffalo skins, rocks, bark, and, later, paper--claimed territorial rights, explained treaties among nations, delineated trade routes, and showed the locations of resources. Many of those maps wound up in dusty attics and the back shelves of museums, where Warhus has hunted them out; his stories of finding these lost treasures are as illuminating as his interpretations of what might be called pre-scientific ways of graphically describing the land. These maps, he writes, are of importance today not only for their own sake, but also as evidence of historic holdings in current claims over lost territories.An absorbing exploration of Native American ways of mapping the land. Warhus, a museum curator, unfolds an account that is at once full of scientific complexities and of human interest. In looking at Native American maps, he invites the reader to consider the detailed knowledge of ``geography, political allegiances, and economic relations'' reflected in them, knowledge largely destroyed in the course of conquest. In case study after case study, he shows how maps made on buffalo skins, rocks, birch bark, and paper, maps that claimed territorial rights and explained treaties with other Indian nations, were simply ignored; many of those maps wound up in the drawing rooms and attics of the conquerors. Some eventually came to rest in museum collections. Warhus has been diligent in hunting these maps out, and we should be glad of it, for many of them are astonishingly detailed--one, made by an Iowa Indian in the mid-1850s, shows the tributaries of the Mississippi River nearly as well as any modern chart, while another, made by one of the last members of the Beothuck people of Newfoundland, is an extraordinary cultural atlas of the northern Atlantic seaboard at the time of the European arrival. To his account of the making of these maps Warhus adds a rich anecdotal history, telling the stories of the kidnaped Indian Miguel, forced to make maps of the southern Plains for the Spanish conquistadors, and of other Native Americans whose knowledge of the countryside was used to the invaders' advantage. Warhus closes his book with a look at modern efforts by the Hopi, Zuni, and other peoples to combine traditional geographies with modern mapmaking techniques, efforts that may be fruitful in pressing indigenous claims to lost territory. This richly illustrated work is a valuable contribution to Native American studies. (90 color and b&amp;w illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reissue.</p><p>In this sequel to Without Honor (Tor Bks., 1989), a paperback original, Kirk McGarvey, ex-CIA assassin, is called into service again as his old enemy, Valentin Baranov, now head of the KGB, begins a move toward the annihilation of Israel and the destruction of Soviet-American relations. Baranov's goal is to bring down Gorbachev and take his place. He has sent Colonel Kurshin to steal a nuclear cruise missile and launch it at En Gedi, where Israel's secret nuclear weapons are stored. Foiled by McGarvey, Kurshin next kidnaps the nuclear submarine Indianapolis . As the tale rolls to a violent conclusion, the author deftly leads McGarvey toward the identity of a Russian mole entrenched in the CIA. Hagberg, who also writes as Sean Flannery, turns glasnost into a springboard for a new crop of espionage tales. This is a nonstop thriller, packed with suspense and action.<br><i>- Jo Ann Vicarel, Cleveland Heights - University Heights P.L., Ohio</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this follow-up to Without Honor, Hagberg reintroduces CIA assassin Kirk McGarvey to unravel a complex puzzle that begins with Soviet agents infiltrating a nuclear center in Israel and hijacking a Pershing missile in Germany. KGB chief Valentin Baranov and his bloodthirsty field man Arkady Kurshin plan to reactivate the Cold War by destroying Israel's nuclear capacity and bringing down Gorbachev. McGarvey's heroics--ranging from Washington to Berlin--foil the scheme. Hagburg, an experienced adventure novelist, borrows from the best: his characters are reminiscent of Ian Fleming; his atmosphere of betrayal and disillusion owes much to John le Carre; and his novel's most exciting episode involves a submarine subplot worthy of Tom Clancy. Though Countdown offers few surprises, it is also a well-crafted secret-agent thriller that will not disappoint fans of the genre. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The 3rd Alternative: Solving Life&#39;s Most Difficult Problems</h2><p><b>From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, hailed as the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century, <i>The 3rd Alternative</i> introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving. </b><br><br>There are many methods of &#x201c;conflict resolution,&#x201d; but most involve compromise, a low-level accommodation that stops the fight without breaking through to new and innovative results. <i>The 3rd Alternative</i> introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving, transcending traditional solutions to conflict by forging a path toward a third option. A third alternative moves beyond your way or my way to a higher and better way&#x2014;one that allows both parties to emerge from debate or even heated conflict in a far better place than either had envisioned. With the third alternative, <i>nobody </i>has to give up anything, and <i>everyone </i>wins.<br> <br>Through key examples and stories from his work as a consultant, Covey demonstrates the power of 3rd Alternative thinking. His wide-ranging examples include a Canadian metropolitan police force that transformed a crime-plagued community; a judge who brought a quick, peaceful end to one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in American history without setting foot in a courtroom; the principal of a high school for children of migrant workers who raised their graduation rate from 30 percent to 90 percent; a handful of little-known people who are quietly finding new ways to bring peace to the Middle East; and many others. These various groups and individuals offer living examples of how to create new and better results instead of escalating conflict, as well as how to build strong relationships based on an attitude of winning together.<br> <br>Beyond conflict and compromise, <i>The 3rd Alternative</i> unveils a radical, creative new way of thinking.</p><p>Recognized as one of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2019;s twenty-five most influential Americans, Stephen R. Covey (1932&#x2013;2012) was an internationally respected leadership authority, family expert, teacher, organizational consultant, and author.&nbsp;His books have sold more than twenty-five million copies&nbsp;in thirty-eight languages, and <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> was named the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century. After receiving an MBA from Harvard and a doctorate degree from Brigham Young University, he became the cofounder and vice chairman of FranklinCovey, a leading global training firm.3rd Alternative <b>1</b><br>The Transition Point<p></p> <br><b>L</b>ife is full of problems. Problems that seem impossible to solve. Personal problems. Family problems. Problems at work, in our neighborhoods, and in the world at large.<br> <br>Perhaps you&#x2019;re in a marriage that started off great, but now you can barely stand each other. You may have estranged relationships with your parents, siblings, or children. It could be that you feel overwhelmed and out of balance at work, always trying to do more with less. Or maybe, like so many others, you are tired of our litigious society, in which people are so quick to sue you don&#x2019;t dare make a move. We worry about crime and its drag on our society. We see politicians going at it and getting nowhere. We watch the news at night and lose hope that the perpetual conflicts between people and nations will ever be resolved.<br> <br>So we lose hope, give up, or settle for a compromise that doesn&#x2019;t feel so good in the end.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve longed to write this book.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s about a principle so fundamental that I believe it can transform your life and the whole world. It is the highest and most important insight I have garnered from studying those people who lead truly effective lives.<br> <br>Basically, it&#x2019;s the key to solving life&#x2019;s most difficult problems.<br> <br>All people suffer adversities, mostly in silence. Most soldier on bravely in the face of their problems, working and hoping for a better future. For many, terror is just under the surface. Some of these terrors are physical, some psychological, but all are very real.<br> <br>If you understand and live by the principle in this book, you may not only conquer your problems, but you may go on to build a future for yourself that&#x2019;s better than you ever imagined possible. I did not discover this principle&#x2014;it&#x2019;s eternal. But for those who apply it to the challenges they face, it&#x2019;s no understatement to say that it may be the greatest discovery of their lives.<br> <br>My book <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> leads up to it. Of all the principles in that book, I called it &#x201c;the most catalytic, the most empowering, the most unifying, and the most exciting.&#x201d; In <i>The 7 Habits,</i> I was able to deal with this principle in only a general way; but in this book, I invite you to explore it with me much more broadly and deeply. If you pay the price to truly understand it, you&#x2019;ll never think the same way again. You&#x2019;ll find yourself approaching your most difficult challenges in life in an entirely new, exponentially more effective way.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m profoundly excited to share with you stories about some rare people who have grasped this principle. They are not only problem solvers but also creators of the new future we all dream of. Among many, you&#x2019;ll read about<br> <br>� A father who rescued his troubled daughter from years of despair and near suicide in one surprising evening.<br> <br>� A young man in India who is solving the problem of electric power for millions of poor people&#x2014;at virtually no cost.<br> <br>� A police chief who cut the juvenile crime rate in a major Canadian city by half.<br> <br>� A woman who is bringing New York&#x2019;s polluted harbor back to life&#x2014;again at almost no cost.<br> <br>� A husband and wife who once could hardly speak to each other and now laugh together about those difficult days.<br> <br>� The judge who brought a quick, peaceful end to the biggest environmental lawsuit in American history&#x2014;without setting foot in a courtroom.<br> <br>� The principal of a high school for migrant workers&#x2019; children who raised the graduation rate from a dismal 30 percent to 90 percent and tripled his students&#x2019; basic skill levels&#x2014;without spending any more money.<br> <br>� A single mother and her teenager who went from bitter confrontation to renewed understanding and affection.<br> <br>� A doctor who cures virtually all his patients of a deadly disease at a fraction of the price other doctors charge.<br> <br>� The team that transformed Times Square from a cesspool of violence and filth to the top tourist attraction in North America.<br> <br>Let me emphasize: none of these is a celebrity with lots of money and influence. All are, for the most part, ordinary people who are successfully applying this supreme principle to their toughest problems. And so can you.<br> <br>I can hear you thinking, &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not trying to do anything heroic like those people. I&#x2019;ve got my own problems, and they&#x2019;re big to me. I&#x2019;m tired, and I just want to find a solution that works.&#x201d;<br> <br>Believe me, there&#x2019;s nothing in this book that isn&#x2019;t both global <i>and</i> personal. The principle applies equally well to a single mother trying her hardest to raise a restless teenager as to a head of state trying to stop a war.<br> <br>You can apply this principle to<br> <br>� A serious conflict at work with your boss or co-workers.<br> <br>� A marriage with &#x201c;irreconcilable differences.&#x201d;<br> <br>� A dispute with your child&#x2019;s school.<br> <br>� A situation that has put you in financial trouble.<br> <br>� A critical decision you have to make on your job.<br> <br>� A battle over some issue in your neighborhood or community.<br> <br>� Family members who quarrel chronically&#x2014;or won&#x2019;t speak to each other at all.<br> <br>� A weight problem.<br> <br>� A job that doesn&#x2019;t satisfy you.<br> <br>� A child who won&#x2019;t &#x201c;launch.&#x201d;<br> <br>� A knotty problem you need to solve for a customer.<br> <br>� An issue that might drag you into court.<br> <br>I have taught the underlying principle of this book for more than forty years to literally hundreds of thousands of people. I&#x2019;ve taught it to young schoolchildren, to rooms full of corporate CEOs, to graduating students, to heads of state in some thirty countries, and to everyone in between. I&#x2019;ve approached all of them in virtually the same way. I have written this book to apply equally well to a playground, a battlefield, a boardroom, a legislative chamber, or a family kitchen.<br> <br>I belong to a world leadership group seeking to build a better relationship between the West and the Islamic community. It includes a former U.S. secretary of state, prominent imams and rabbis, global business leaders, and experts on conflict resolution. At our first meeting, it became obvious that everyone had an agenda. It was all rather formal and cool, and you could just feel the tension. That was on a Sunday.<br> <br>I asked permission from the group to teach them one principle before we went any further, and they graciously agreed. So I taught them the message of this book.<br> <br>By Tuesday night the whole atmosphere had changed. The private agendas had been shelved. We had arrived at an exciting resolution that we had never anticipated. The people in the room were filled with respect and love for one another&#x2014;you could see it, and you could feel it. The former secretary of state whispered to me, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything so powerful. What you&#x2019;ve done here could totally revolutionize international diplomacy.&#x201d; More on this later.<br> <br>As I said, you don&#x2019;t have to be a global diplomat to put this principle to work on your own challenges. Recently we surveyed people around the world to find out what their top challenges were personally, on the job, and in the world at large. It was not a representative sample; we just wanted to find out what different people had to say. The 7,834 people who responded were from every continent and from every level of every kind of organization.<br> <br>� <i>In their personal lives.</i> The challenge they feel most personally is the pressure of overwork, coupled with job dissatisfaction. Many are having relationship problems. Typically, one middle manager from Europe writes, &#x201c;I get stressed, feeling burned out, and don&#x2019;t have time and energy to do things for me.&#x201d; Another says, &#x201c;My family is going wrong and it tips everything else out of balance.&#x201d;<br> <br>� <i>On the job.</i> Of course, people&#x2019;s top job concerns are always scarce capital and profits. But many are also worried about losing ground in the global game: &#x201c;We are very much stuck in our 100-year tradition. . . . We&#x2019;re becoming more irrelevant every day. . . . Too little use is made of creativity and entrepreneurship.&#x201d; From Africa, a top manager wrote, &#x201c;I was working for an international company, but I resigned last year. I left because I could no longer find meaning in what I was doing.&#x201d;<br> <br>� <i>In the world.</i> From our respondents&#x2019; viewpoint, the top three challenges we face as a human family are war and terrorism, poverty, and the slow destruction of the environment. An Asian middle manager struck a pleading tone: &#x201c;Our country belongs to one of the poorest in Asia. This is the battle cry among [us] where the majority of our population lives in poverty. There is a lack of employment, poor education, infrastructure facilities are hardly available, huge debt, poor governance, and corruption is rampant.&#x201d;1<br> <br>This is a snapshot view of how our friends and neighbors are feeling. They might list different challenges tomorrow, but I suspect we&#x2019;d see only variations on the same sorts of pain.<br> <br>Under these mounting pressures, we fight each other more. The twentieth century was an age of impersonal war, but the twenty-first seems like an age of personal malice. The rage thermometer is way up. Families quarrel, co-workers contend, cyber bullies terrorize, courts are jammed, and fanatics murder the innocent. Contemptuous &#x201c;commentators&#x201d; swamp the media&#x2014;the more outrageous their attacks, the more money they make.<br> <br>This rising fever of contention can make us ill. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing the Other. . . . The worst eras in human history start like this, with negative otherizing. And then they morph into violent extremism,&#x201d; says the wellness expert Elizabeth Lesser.2 We know too well where this sort of thing leads.<br> <br>So how <i>do</i> we resolve our most divisive conflicts and solve our most difficult problems?<br> <br>� Do we go on the warpath, determined that we <i>won&#x2019;t</i> take it anymore, but we <i>will</i> take it out on our &#x201c;enemies&#x201d;?<br> <br>� Do we play the victim, helplessly waiting for someone to save us?<br> <br>� Do we take positive thinking to the extreme and slip into a pleasant state of denial?<br> <br>� Do we sit back stoically, with no real hope that things will ever get better? Deep down, do we believe that all the prescriptions are just placebos anyway?<br> <br>� Do we keep plugging away, like most people of goodwill, doing what we&#x2019;ve always done in the slim hope that things will <i>somehow</i> get better?<br> <br>No matter what approach we take to our problems, natural consequences will follow. War begets war, victims become dependent, reality crushes people in denial, cynics contribute nothing. And if we keep doing the same things we&#x2019;ve always done, hoping that <i>this</i> time the results will be different, we are not facing reality. Albert Einstein reportedly said, &#x201c;The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>To solve our most difficult problems, we must radically change our thinking</i>&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s what this book is about.<br> <br>As you read, you will find yourself poised on a transition point between your past, whatever it has been, and a future you have never imagined until now. You will discover within yourself a talent for change. You will think about your problems in an entirely revolutionary way. You will develop new mental reflexes that will propel you through barriers others find insurmountable.<br> <br>You will be able to see from that transition point a new future for yourself&#x2014;and the years ahead might be not at all what you expected. Instead of halting into an inevitable future of diminishing capacity riddled with problems, you can start now to fulfill your hunger for a life &#x201c;in crescendo&#x201d; that is always fresh and meaningful and filled with extraordinary contributions&#x2014;right to the end.<br> <br>By recentering your life on the principle of this book, you will find a surprising way forward into that future.<br> <br></p><h2>Gracious Leadership</h2><p>In today's cut-throat, get-ahead-at-all-costs world, the idea of showing basic decency towards one another has sadly been pushed to the side. Yet, the power of respectful, positive leadership can be more impactful now than ever before. <br><br> Gracious leaders stand apart because they have a better way. Leaders who listen with purpose, recognize they don't have all the answers, and demonstrate uncompromising respect to all can-and will-lead their teams to peak performance. In Gracious Leadership: Lead Like You've Never Led Before, Janet Smith Meeks describes why the key ingredients of Gracious Leadership are proven "must have" strategies to optimize organizational results. Meeks explains that teams of all types, within any industry, can and will reap great rewards by displaying respectful behaviors as they seek to reach greater heights. This holds true at home, on the basketball court, in the C-suite, or in the boardroom. <br><br> Through stories of her own personal journey, as well as anecdotes about those she's encountered along the way, Meeks shares lessons learned while offering candid advice to help leaders improve. In a dog-eat-dog world where leadership crises are prevalent and the disrespect of subordinates is widespread, Meeks offers a different path. She shows how to be tough and kind, straightforward and compassionate, driven and grateful, all while being a fully respectful leader. Gracious Leadership... it's not soft stuff... it's a fresh and strategic approach for current and aspiring leaders who seek to excel while restoring common decency and respect within all aspects of their lives.</p><p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Hawaii (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b>Lonely Planet <i>Hawaii</i> </b>is your passport to all the most relevant and up-to-date advice on what to see, what to skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.<i> </i>Learn to surf or lie in the sun on a sugary tropical beach, hike across ancient lava flows and up craggy peaks, or curve down Maui's lushest coast on the Road to Hana; all with your trusted travel companion.

As author Anthony Piscitelli demonstrates, the USMC has maintained its position as the nation&#x2019;s foremost striking force while shifting its thrust from a reliance upon attrition to a return to maneuver warfare. Piscitelli methodically explains the evolution by using traditional and first-person accounts by the prime movers of this paradigm shift.<br><br>In Indochina, for example, the Marines not only held territory but engaged in now-legendary confrontational battles at Hue and Khe Sanh. As a percentage of those engaged, the Marines suffered higher casualties than any other branch of the service. In the post-Vietnam assessment, however, the USMC absorbed Sun Tzu&#x2019;s aspects of Asian warfare and returned to its historical DNA in fighting &#x201c;small wars&#x201d; to evolve a superior alternative to the battlefield.<br><br>The institutionalization of maneuver philosophy began with the Marine Corps&#x2019; educational system, analyzing the actual battlespace of warfare&#x2014;be it humanitarian assistance, regular set-piece battles, or irregular guerrilla war&#x2014;and the role that the leadership cadre of the Marine Corps played in this evolutionary transition from attrition to maneuver. This change has sometimes been incorrectly portrayed (including by the Congressional Military Reform Caucus) as a disruptive or forced evolution. Analysis from former commandants of the Marine Corps to junior officers on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere demonstrate otherwise. The ability of the Marines to impact the battlefield&#x2014;and help achieve our strategic goals&#x2014;has only increased during the post-Cold War era.<br><br>Throughout The Marine Corps Way of War, the voices of the Marines themselves, in action or through analysis, describe how &#x201c;the few, the proud&#x201d; will continue to be America&#x2019;s cutting-edge force in the future as we move through the 21st Century. This new work is must-reading for not only every Marine, but for everyone interested in the evolution of the world&#x2019;s finest military force.</p><p>Anthony (&#x201c;Tony&#x201d;) Piscitelli, Ph.D., is currently an adjunct professor in the Global Transportation Department-SUNY Maritime College, where he teaches graduate and undergraduate Maritime Security classes. He is an acknowledged expert in security and physical and electronic security anti-terrorism systems specializing in blast, ballistic and forced entry mitigation. Dr. Piscitelli played an active role in Global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom for the Departments of State and Defense. He spent a significant amount of time working with Arab Christians at risk in Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel, directing his efforts at educational scholarships, affordable housing, and the development of the Lutheran Church&#x2019;s Ecumenical Center at the Jordan River Baptismal Site. In addition, Dr. Piscitelli has been a benefactor for both the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation, the Marine Corps Council of New York City, and the Marine Corps&#x2019; Semper Fi Fund. The Marine Corps Way of War: The Evolution of the U.S. Marine Corps from Attrition to Maneuver Warfare in the Post-Vietnam Era is his first book.&#x201c;The Service that wrote the book on insurgencies, amphibious warfare, helicopters, close air support and maneuver warfare continues to show the way into the cyber age. The author does an admirable job of chronicling the ingenuity and adaptability of the Marine Corps in cutting through the fog of war to stay ahead of potential enemies. A dramatic and intriguing story.&#x201d; (Bernard E. Trainor, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret.))<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Piscitelli has filled in a key gap in the evolution of how the Marine Corps fights. His study of the adaptation of the philosophy of maneuver warfare, from its introduction in the training areas of Camp Lejeune to its ultimate validation in Iraq, Afghanistan, and small actions worldwide, details the struggle to prepare the Marine Corps for the world, post-Vietnam. The import of that change cannot be overstated, nor can the struggle it took to make that change. Brilliant stuff.&#x201d; (Richard P. Mills, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret.))<br><br>Robert Coram, author of Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War (Robert Coram, author of Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War)<br><br>&#x201c;An impressively informed and informative study, "The Marine Corps Way of War: The Evolution of the U.S. Marine Corps from Attrition to Maneuver Warfare in the Post-Vietnam Era" is a singularly original work of outstanding scholarship that is so exceptionally well written, organized and presented as to make it fully accessible for academia and non-specialist general readers alike.&#x201d; (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...a helpful introduction into maneuver warfare&#x2019;s main doctrinal tenets: commander&#x2019;s intent, mission-type orders, trust tactics, speed of decision making, attacking weak spots, surprise, shock, and shattering the enemy&#x2019;s cohesion.&#x201d; (Col Thomas C.

Ryan could see the wild child silhouetted by the hell ball of the emerging sun, his shoulder-length mane of white hair flying, his Magnum Colt Python in his fist. In wire-rimmed spectacles and screwed-down fedora, the diminutive J. B. Dix held down the column's rear with his M-4000 12-gauge pump. Ryan's lover, the long-legged Krysty Wroth, jogged on his left with her Smith &amp; Wesson Model 640 .38-caliber revolver in hand. Krysty's emerald eyes searched the dim verge of the roadway ahead, her red, prehensile mutie hair drawn up into tight curls of alarm. Ryan carried his SIG-Sauer P-226 with a 9 mm round chambered, safety off, index finger stiffened outside the trigger guard. His prized long-blaster, a scoped, Steyr SSG 70 sniper rifle, was strapped tightly over his shoulder and back by its sling, slap-proofed.</p><p>Behind Ryan and Krysty, in the middle of the pack, were the group's pair of time travelers.</p><p>Theophilus Algernon Tanner had been ripped from the bosom of his young family in the late 1880s, time-trawled against his will by the whitecoats of Operation Chronos. Caught in their net, he had been dragged forward to 1998, the first subject to survive the time travel experiment. If the whitecoats expected their Victorian lab rat to appreciate the Big Picture and be grateful for the sake of science and the expansion of knowledge, they were very much disappointed. They were so arrogant, so oblivious, that they never considered his outrage over the kidnapping, or his continuing grief over the loss of his loved ones. After months of captivity and near-constant poking and prodding by Operation Chronos technicians, Tanner became an intractable embarrassment. Shortly before Armageddon, to be rid of him and as punishment for his truculence, the whitecoats sent the Harvard- and Oxford-educated scholar forward in time.</p><p>It was an act of intentional cruelty that had saved his life.</p><p>Doc Tanner didn't look over two hundred years old; he looked a fit sixty and his biological age was actually mid-thirties. His teeth were still excellent. A tall scarecrow in a tattered frock coat and tall leather boots, he loped with a sheathed, ebony sword cane in one hand and his massive, Civil War-era black-powder blaster in the other.</p><p>Beside him, Dr. Mildred Wyeth kept pace, ready to cut loose, deadly accurate, with her .38-caliber Czech-made ZKR 551 target revolver, the same make and model weapon that had helped her earn a freestyle shooting silver medal in the last-ever Olympic Games. The African-American physician had been cryogenically frozen on December 28, 2000, a few weeks prior to skydark, after an adverse reaction to anesthetic during surgery. Dr. Wyeth had slept in suspended animation for more than a century before the companions freed her. Like Tanner, Mildred was still in her midthirties, biologically speaking. As she ran, the beaded plaits of her hair clicked together, keeping time with her steady footfalls.</p><p>Triple red.</p><p>Along the shoulders of both sides of the road, thorny, tangled scrub brush grew waist high. The unbroken walls of cover were made to order for a close-range cross fire and ambush.</p><p>Using the predark mat-trans system was always a gamble because so many things could go wrong, midjump and postjump. The mat-trans gateways had been designed to surreptitiously move personnel and goods between the government's deep subterranean redoubts, which were scattered across the continent. The companions had no control over their destination, except that it was someplace other than where they started. This time they had materialized in a pitch-black, east Texas redoubt, perilously close to the Houston nuke-a-thon's ground zero.</p><p>Using precious flashlight batteries for illumination, they had attempted to jump again, but the system wouldn't power up. They tried the Last Destination button with the same result. They were stuck and in the dark. The redoubt's lights wouldn't come on, either. Apparently the nuke reactor had had one last burst of power left in it. They were radblasted lucky to have materialized at all.</p><p>To conserve their batteries, they had lit torches made of paper, cardboard and rags&#x2014;whatever debris they could find&#x2014;and explored the deserted, underground complex, looking for a way out.</p><p>The reason why nothing worked soon became apparent. High-water marks stained the walls near the ceiling. The redoubt had been flooded at some time in the past. Dried mud, like beige talcum powder, coated walls, floors, comps, desktops, overturned chairs, and the crumbling litter of printout paper. Corrosive salts from the water had etched silicon chips and circuit boards into junk.</p><p>To keep from inhaling the potentially dangerous dust their footsteps raised, they had covered their faces with kerchiefs.</p><p>In a side room, they found a 3-D plastic topographic map of the Houston area, all the way to the Gulf coast. On the opposite wall was a row of large, glass-faced dials. J.B. and Ryan had brushed the dried mud from the faces and the engraved plastic labels beneath them. The units were radiation counters, connected to distant remote sensors. The name plates read: Central Houston, South Houston, Bunker Hill Village, Lynchburg, La Porte. The counters were nonfunctional; all but one of the needles was pinned in the red&#x2014;the Barrett dial was stuck in mid-arc. Which had two possible meanings: that area had been hit by less radiation on nukeday, or the dial's mechanism had broken and its needle had fallen back from the little post at the far edge of the red.</p><p>Because the companions had no alternative, they took it to mean the former, that the Barrett direction was the only safe corridor leading away from ground zero. Every second they remained in the hotspot, they got a bigger dose of rads. Even though it was the middle of the night, they had to go, and go quickly.</p><p>There was another problem, too. Though they had water and jerky left in their packs, it wasn't enough to fuel a multiday journey. Not when they were running full-tilt. The Houston redoubt's stores, although untouched by looters, were useless to them. What wasn't ruined by the water was most likely contaminated by radiation carried in by the flooding, so there was nothing they could risk eating or drinking. Rad-tainted material was like a timebomb in the guts as well as the lungs, a constant source of poison that gradually sickened and eventually chilled.</p><p>After they found the exit to the surface and J.B. had taken a compass bearing, they headed south, cross country, until they intersected what was left of the old County Road 90. If they kept traveling east on the ruined road, they knew eventually they'd hit Louisiana, and safety. There was no way of knowing what the ambient rad levels actually were; that's why they kept the masks over their faces.</p><p>The gathering Texas dawn revealed a flat, featureless landscape, a plain of dense, twisted, black vegetation that the rising sun could not brighten or penetrate. To Ryan, the sea of brush looked like it had been burned by a terrible wildfire, but he knew it hadn't. The cruelly spiked scrub had sprung from the ashes of Armageddon, a stubborn mutation that defied the effects of toxic soil, air and water. Its fat, lobate fruits&#x2014;a gaudy orange, and bigger than a man's fist&#x2014;hung in heavy clusters and lay in scattered, rotting piles along the shoulder. In the motionless air they gave off a sickeningly sweet smell, like an exploded joy-juice still.</p><p>Food gathering was not an option for them. They were too close to the Houston craters; the fruit wasn't safe to eat. And they had to cover as much ground as they could before the day really heated up and the threat of death by dehydration forced them to stop and find shade until evening.</p><p>They had made the right choice for a getaway route. Dawn also revealed that County Road 90 was well traveled. Narrow, knobby tires had gouged countless, crisscrossing ruts in the black asphalt sand. Predark motorbikes were the answer to the hellscape's ravaged highways. They used minimal fuel and could run at high speeds offroad to avoid pursuit. There was no chance of getting drive-wheels stuck in mud. Obstacles could be circumnavigated. Motorcycles were ideal for small-payload traders and bands of hit-and-git coldhearts. If someone was lucky enough to score one.</p><p>After the sun rose they holstered their sidearms; J.B. slung his scattergun. The likelihood of a surprise attack had diminished, as they could see for miles across the almost tabletop-flat landscape.</p><p>As Ryan ran, beads of perspiration trickled in a steady stream from his hairline, following the ragged edge of the welt of scar that split his left eyebrow. He kept brushing away the sweat to keep it from seeping under the black eyepatch he wore and burning into the socket emptied by a knife slash years ago. He couldn't brush away the familiar ache in the pit of his belly or the burning dryness in his throat. Hunger and thirst were elements of daily life in the hellscape, sometimes in the background, sometimes in the foreground, but always somewhere in the mix.</p><p>With Jak in the lead, the companions climbed a slight grade for about a mile under the brightening sky, then the roadbed ...</p></p><h2>A Bold and Dangerous Family: The Remarkable Story of an Italian Mother, Her Two Sons, and Their Fight Against Fascism (The Resistance Quartet, 3)</h2><p><p><strong>A <em>New York Times Book Review</em> Editor&#x2019;s Choice</strong></p><p><strong>The acclaimed author of <em>A Train in Winter</em> and <em>Village of Secrets</em> delivers the next chapter in "The Resistance Quartet": the astonishing story of the aristocratic Italian family who stood up to Mussolini's fascism, and whose efforts helped define the path of Italy in the years between the World Wars&#x2014;a profile in courage that remains relevant today.</strong></p><p>Members of the cosmopolitan, cultural aristocracy of Florence at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Rosselli family, led by their fierce matriarch, Amelia, were vocal anti-fascists. As populist, right-wing nationalism swept across Europe after World War I, and Italy&#x2019;s Prime Minister, Benito Mussolini, began consolidating his power, Amelia&#x2019;s sons Carlo and Nello led the opposition, taking a public stand against Il Duce that few others in their elite class dared risk. When Mussolini established a terrifying and brutal police state controlled by his Blackshirts&#x2014;the <em>squaddristi</em>&#x2014;the Rossellis and their anti-fascist circle were transformed into active resisters.</p><p>In retaliation, many of the anti-fascists were arrested and imprisoned; others left the country to escape a similar fate. Tragically, Carlo and Nello were eventually assassinated by Mussolini&#x2019;s secret service. After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, Amelia, thanks to visas arranged by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt herself, fled to New York City with the remaining members of her family.</p><p>Renowned historian Caroline Moorehead paints an indelible picture of Italy in the first half of the twentieth century, offering an intimate account of the rise of Il Duce and his <em>squaddristi</em>; life in Mussolini&#x2019;s penal colonies; the shocking ambivalence and complicity of many prominent Italian families seduced by Mussolini&#x2019;s promises; and the bold, fractured resistance movement whose associates sacrificed their lives to fight fascism. In <em>A Bold and Dangerous Family</em>, Moorehead once again pays tribute to heroes who fought to uphold our humanity during one of history&#x2019;s darkest chapters. </p><p><em>A Bold and Dangerous Family</em> is illustrated with black-and-white photographs.</p></p><p><p>Mussolini was not only ruthless; he was subtle and manipulative. Black-shirted thugs did his dirty work for him: arson, murder, destruction of homes and offices, bribery, and intimidation. His opponents&#x2014;including editors, publishers, union representatives, lawyers, and judges&#x2014;were beaten into submission. But the tide turned in 1924, when his henchmen went too far; horror spread across Italy, and twenty years of struggle began. Anti-fascist resistance was born and it would end only with Mussolini&#x2019;s death in 1945. Among those whose disgust hardened into bold and uncompromising resistance was a family from Florence: Amelia, Carlo, and Nello Rosselli.</p><p>In <em>A Bold and Dangerous Family</em>, Caroline Moorehead draws on letters and diaries never previously translated into English to reveal, in all their intimacy, a family driven by loyalty, duty, and courage, yet susceptible to all the self-doubt and fear to which humans are prey. Readers will be drawn into the lives of this remarkable family&#x2014;and their loves, their loyalties, and their ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Caroline Moorehead is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Village of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France</em>; <em>A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship, and Resistance in Occupied France</em>; and <em>Human Cargo: A Journey Among Refugees</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Ann, the self-appointed Queen of Christmas, has been working on "The List" since just after Christmas last year. After all, if she forgets <i>anything</i>, "that would make Christmas not quite as wonderful as it should be." So, although she has a marvelous time ice-skating with Grandma, perhaps a sparkly red skating outfit would make it better. And going sledding with her father on his old wooden sled is great, but still, it might be nice to have a brand-new plastic one. <p> It might sound as though Ann Estelle should really be called the Spoiled Princess of Christmas, but in truth, she&#x2019;s just a normal little girl bedazzled by the "golden gift-getting opportunity" of Christmas. And--with no parental prodding whatsoever--our little heroine closes the story with the kind of moral every parent would like to hear: "Oh, Dad, it&#x2019;s not just the presents that matter.

He's the Food Network's latest sensation, a <em>Today Show</em> regular, and a <em>GQ</em> man of the month. His audience appeal keeps growing, and his primetime show on the Food Network continues to reap huge ratings as he teaches everyone the secret behind fresh, simple, delicious cooking.<br><br> In <em>The Naked Chef Takes Off</em>, TV's hottest young chef (<em>USA Weekend</em>) returns to offer even more delectable stripped-down recipes with basic ingredients and a minimum of fuss. In this new book, Jamie features fantastic breakfasts, tapas, roasts, fish dishes, and desserts to die for. Best of all, each of the recipes is accompanied by Jamie's winning, off-the-cuff commentary and straightforward food philosophy (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>) that will encourage confidence and inspire both new and experienced cooks. Filled throughout with gorgeous photographs of both the recipes and the chef, here is a book to savor and to share.</p><p>Affable Essex boy Jamie Oliver continues the British culinary invasion with <i>The Naked Chef Takes Off</i>, the smashing follow-up to his bestselling <i>The Naked Chef</i>. For Oliver, the young Food Network import, food is all about "passing the potatoes around the table, ripping up some bread, licking my fingers, getting tipsy, and enjoying the company of good friends and family," and cooking up "what real people at home really want." The thing is, "real people" picking up cookbooks are often seeking easy-to-follow recipes. But that's not Oliver's bag. The layout of many of his recipes may frustrate traditional-cookbook readers--instructions often appear as one big chunk of conversational text with nary an ingredient or measurement in clear view--but that's part of the charm of Oliver's cookbooks. His commentary, tips, and cooking steps come across in a very approachable, colloquial style and leave plenty of room for individual flair or improvisation. Oliver's enthusiasm for cooking is infectious; the recipes and chapter introductions spill out like a best mate who just can't stop talking about food and how much fun--and simple--it can be to whip up these spectacular dishes. <p> Oliver kicks things off by stocking your pantry with best-quality ingredients, and he's an apostle for fresh herbs, raving on about growing and drying your own at home. "Morning Glory" is a chapter full of dishes like Midnight Pan-Cooked Breakfast (bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, sausages, and eggs brought together in the "biggest nonstick pan available" and sopped up with buttered toast--a rustic one-dish cure for any oncoming hangover). "Tapas, Munchies, and Snacks" brings Slow-Cooked and Stuffed Baby Cherry Chili Peppers to the table (when you're done snacking on the chilies, you're left with a jar of terrific flavored oil, perfect for salads or pasta). There's Squashed Cherry Tomato and Smashed Olive Salad, and a Fragrant Thai Broth, infused with lemongrass, ginger, and lime leaves. Once you've mastered his basic risotto recipe you can turn out Shrimp and Peas Risotto with Basil and Mint, and likewise his basic bread recipe is the foundation for Chocolate Twister Bread. "Easy peasy" dessert ideas like Strawberries Marinated in Balsamic Vinegar or Malted Milk Balls and Ice Cream (bash a big bag of Whoppers into bits and sprinkle over quality vanilla ice cream) are a refreshing end to any meal. Now, be a "right little tiger" and get cooking--Seared Scallops and Crispy Prosciutto with Roasted Tomatoes and Smashed White Beans and other fabulous dishes await. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i></p><strong>Jamie Oliver</strong> grew up in his parents' country pub, the Cricketers in Clavering, where he started cooking at the age of eight, before studying at London's Westminster Catering College.

If I had known how being bad&#x2019; would be part of his charm and would add to his success on camera, I might have given this more thought. I was impressed with the legendary school&#x2019;s sales pitch, including their money-back guarantee. But when I said my dog was a beagle, there was dead silence on her end of the phone . . . then a good-natured laugh. I was just kidding about the guarantee.&#x2019;&#x201d; Television reporter Dick Wolfsie was walking out his front door on the way to the studio one wintry morning when he found a shivering beagle pup on his front steps. Dick placed the stray inside the house and was off to work. When he returned four hours later, his wife and young son were cleaning up what remained of the shredded couch, the living room curtains, and his wife&#x2019;s favorite high heels. The family would soon demand that Dick either take the dog to work with him each day or find the troublemaker a minimum security facility. So, off to the station they went. And ultimately Barney nosed his way in front of the camera with Dick. Soon the dynamic duo would make TV history. For ten years more than 2,500 morning news shows fans watched the renegade pooch chew, howl, and dig his way through every one of Dick&#x2019;s reports. But he also burrowed his way into everybody&#x2019;s heart, becoming a beloved media star. <i>Mornings with Barney</i> is a hoot from start to finish, but more than this, it is the moving story of a mischievous pooch who touched and brightened the lives of an entire community.</p><p><strong>Dick Wolfsie</strong>, an Emmy-Award-winner has been a television talk show host and reporter for almost thirty years. The former high school psychology teacher is also a syndicated newspaper columnist and author of eleven books. He lives in Indianapolis with his wife, Mary Ellen, and his son, Brett, and his second beagle, Toby. Oh, and Angel, the cat.<br>Syndicated humor columnist Wolfsie pens an insightful and delightfully unsentimental biography of his dog, Barney, who became a legendary figure in central Indiana. When Wolfsie was a television feature reporter during the 1970s, he awoke one morning to the sounds of a howling stray beagle. After taking him in&#x2014;and coming home from work to find that the dog had shredded a good deal of his house&#x2014;Wolfsie began taking the newly named Barney to work with him, where his on- and off-set antics became the hit of the show, leading to a new "human/canine team" whose adventures lasted for more than a decade (the station management especially liked it when Barney, on-air, relieved himself on a competing station's advertising). Barney appeared at schools and state fairs, fulfilling the mission that Wolfsie describes as the unique ability "to touch lives." In the end, while it is deeply moving when Barney dies, it is sadder still&#x2014;for both author and reader&#x2014;as Wolfsie cogently observes how corporate cutbacks in news operations have ended the era when such features as the onscreen antics of a lovable beagle were an integral part of local newscasts. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you are like most Americans, you've become distracted by pastimes, passions, pleasures and psycho-sensory over-stimulation. The "Technotronic Era" is here. With it comes a New World of "non-lethal" biological and chemical weapons, and warfare applications, that are being waged against defenseless civilians. Regardless of what you now think, you are being manipulated and lethally affected, and this intelligence may be crucial to you and your family's survival. Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare (ISBN: 0-923550-30-5) delivers the most heretical message in the annals of world health and American medicine, backed by the most astonishing hard-hitting documents ever revealed.

Exquisitely detailed in this book are the most advanced developments in the field of population control.

Jeremiah was called by God to the unhappy task of telling an unheeding nation it was going to be judged and destroyed. Often he seemed to despair, yet he continued to utter God&#39;s truth fearlessly, leaving as part of his spiritual legacy a demonstration of a man&#39;s ability to make religious life an essentially personal relationship with God. The structural analysis of this commentary, along with the historical and cultural background it provides, opens up to modern readers one of the Old Testament&#39;s most fascinating books.</p><p>The late R.

At last, the puppeteer who has performed Elmo for nearly twenty years comes out from behind the stage to share his story. Weaving together his memories of growing up with the life lessons gained from his furry red alter ego, Kevin reveals himself to be as caring, and as eager to grow and learn and love, as the very special character he brings to life.<br><br>You will discover how young Kevin honed his talent entertaining the kids in his mother&#x2019;s home day care with puppets he made from slippers and coat liners; how, as a struggling young artist, he realized his dream to meet and then work for his idol, Muppet creator Jim Henson; and how each and every day of performing Elmo reinforces for him what is most important in life.<br><br>As Kevin has been inspired by Elmo, now we can all learn from his furry red ways. Kevin&#x2019;s (and Elmo&#x2019;s) thoughts on love, creativity, friendship, and optimism remind us of life&#x2019;s simple truths and ultimately encourage us all to be a little bit more like Elmo&#x2013;to live with joy, to love more easily, and to laugh more often.</p><p>Kevin Clash has been with <i>Sesame Stree</i>t for twenty-six years and is coexecutive producer of &#x201c;Elmo&#x2019;s World.&#x201d; He has won three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x2019;s Series and six for his work as coexecutive producer of an Outstanding Pre-School Children&#x2019;s Series. He has a daughter, Shannon, and lives in New York City.<b>1<br><br>Love</b><br>When I tell folks what I do for a living ("<i>What'dya mean you're</i> Elmo? <i>You're a forty-five-year-old six-foot African American male with a deep voice, get outta here</i>"), after they regain their composure, they ask me to explain Elmo's popularity. Elmo is instantly recognizable in nearly every country in the world. He knows heads of state, A-list celebrities, world-class athletes, Oscar winners, Tony winners, Grammy winners, spelling-bee winners, and lots of babies. If Elmo had a cell phone, it would never stop ringing. Why is this little fur-and-foam bundle of energy such a phenomenon?<br><br>I have a one-word answer: love. Elmo connects with children and adults on the purest and most fundamental level, and that is the human desire to love and be loved. It's as simple as that.<br><br>Though I've said "Elmo loves you" thousands of times, maybe millions, the thrill remains because children crave hearing that they are loved. (So do most adults, even if they won't admit it.) And kids love to say it back--"I love you, too!"--and you know they mean it, no matter how many times they say it.<br><br>"I love you." Those are magic words--basic, simple, easy to say, but as adults we often forget their power. We often forget to say them. But Elmo reminds me on a daily basis that love is the foundation for a happy life. And before we can love each other, we have to learn to love ourselves.<br><br>Back home in Turner's Station, a blue-collar community located just east of downtown Baltimore, Maryland, there was plenty of love to go around. In fact, my mom had so much love to give that she shared it with all the neighbor kids, running a family-style daycare center out of our two-bedroom, one-bath home. My siblings--Georgie (the oldest, George Jr.), big sister Anita (we called her Ne-Ne), and little sister Pam--grew up in a kind of kid heaven, where children and love naturally intersected and were never in short supply.<br><br>Money, however, was. Officially, my hometown is called Turner Station, but we always referred to it as Turner's Station--just tradition among the locals, I guess. It's fitting that the name confusion exists, because there really are two towns in my mind--the Turner's Station of my youth and memory and the Turner Station of a harsher reality. My father worked hard as a flash welder operator at Raymond Metals to put a roof over our heads, and Mom's daycare work supplemented his income. But that said, I never, ever felt poor in that house, though there were days when all we had for dinner were mayonnaise sandwiches.<br><br>Our small brick ranch house on New Pittsburgh Avenue was an unremarkable structure, not much different (at least on the outside) from most others in the neighborhood. It had a side entry and a two-step cement stoop where the neighborhood men often sat smoking and chatting in the quiet of a summer's evening. A chain-link fence kept the constant flow of bicycle, tricycle, wagon, hopscotch, and jump-rope traffic off our small patch of lawn and out of the few geraniums, petunias, and four-o'clocks my mother tried to keep thriving in her front-yard garden.<br><br>If our property was remarkable in any way, it was because we had two sheds in the backyard instead of the usual one. My father was, and is, an inveterate pack rat. His excuse was that in addition to his day job, he brought in money by being a neighborhood handyman. So any scrap he could salvage from a demolition or remodeling job went into the bursting-at-the-seams shed.<br><br>"You can't believe what someone threw away today," he'd announce at dinner, recounting his latest find. Before long, like my dad, I started saving and salvaging my own scraps--old buttons, fabric, a worn-out fuzzy slipper, odd bits of plastic or Styrofoam, boxes--any materials that I could turn into the simple puppets I began building and fiddling with as a child.<br><br>Now, lest you start picturing a Sanford and Son type of junk lot--even though Dad was often told that he looked like Redd Foxx--you need to know that our house sat just a few hundred yards from the Chesapeake Bay. We had a huge backyard dominated by a willow tree, and beyond our lawn a field of tall fescue grass waved in the warm breezes off the water. Depending on the wind direction and tide, the air was filled with the sweet scent of the salty water or the fertile smell of the tacky mudflats we delighted stomping through in search of seashells. On the worst days, the chemical odors from the nearby Bethlehem Steel mill at Sparrows Point overpowered all.<br><br>We lived within a half hour ride of vibrant downtown Baltimore, yet our neighborhood was a bucolic mix of homes and vacant fields where we roamed and aired our young imaginations. Necessity remained the true mother of invention, however, and we kids weren't the only creative ones. I still remember one field where enterprising Mr. Shelton parked a school bus he had converted into a general store. Mom would send me to this mobile pit stop for a few necessities, saving her a trip to Miss Hill's grocery farther away on Wade Street.<br><br>My mom was the ultimate "working mother," before that phrase came into vogue. Not only was she busy raising my siblings and me, she had a house full of neighborhood kids in the daycare center she ran. As a result, growing up, my home was filled with the controlled (and sometimes uncontrolled) chaos that children bring. With the four of us there, plus the half dozen or so kids from the neighborhood Mom watched, all that energy exerted a magnetic pull on other toddlers and preteens in the neighborhood.<br><br>Our house was a place where many kids took their first staggering steps, where the smell of baby powder and dirty diapers dueled for dominance, and where each evening my mother leaned her hip wearily against the counter as she prepared dinner, while I sat at the table making art with assorted empty cereal and Kleenex boxes, colored paper, crayons, and Elmer's glue. I kept one eye on my creation-in-progress and the other on the paper towel roll, waiting for that last sheet to be torn off so I could pounce on the cardboard cylinder and claim it.<br><br>I undoubtedly inherited my "crafty" instincts from my parents, Gladys and George Clash. Mom sewed like a pro, and Dad loved to draw and make things, and they often got into the spirit of creating with us kids. Once, after a huge snowstorm, my parents helped us construct a massive snow fort--a squared-off igloo. Mom made a flag for us to fly using iron-on letters on red cloth. Though the snow melted, the name we gave to our winter playhouse stuck, and the red flag found a place in our living room. From that point forward my house was known as Fort McKids.<br><br>Between neighborhood children, my many relatives who lived nearby, the daycare kids and their parents constantly dropping by, our home life was structured mayhem. And as on <i>Sesame Street</i>, humor was a mainstay. I'm grateful for having grown up in what was basically "kid central," because it later made being on the set of <i>Sesame Street</i> feel like I was back with my family. With that many kids around, you can be sure that on any given day, the house was populated by at least one grouch and several monsters, and a cookie was certainly something to be devoured, not savored or shared.<br><br>Though our house was modest, my sense of home felt larger than our four walls. It extended into the multitude of other homes in which I felt welcome. As a kid, I loved the <i>Sesame Street</i> song, "People in Your Neighborhood," because it perfectly captured the connectedness I felt in mine. The homes of our neighbors, Mr. Bernard and his wife, Miss Rose, and Mr. Melvin and Miss Lee, as well as Miss Ada, Miss Marie, and Miss Eunice, were nearly as familiar as my own. I can still taste the crabs my father's friend Kakie (never Mr. Kakie, always just Kakie) shared with us.<br><br>No matter how much activity was going on in the house, I always carved out time to watch <i>Sesame Street</i> and other children's shows. My mother never used television as an electronic babysitter, but I'm like so many of my generation with a fierce devotion to the medium that came into our homes on a small screen and somehow enlarged our world beyond all measure.<br><br><i>Sesame Street</i> first aired when I was ten years old, and as soon as I heard the sprightly opening bars of the theme song, I was entranced. I was one of those up-close sitters. I'd park myself a few inches from the RCA color television set we had. I was so close, I could feel the static electricity of the screen tugging at the peach fuzz on my face and smell the wonderful aroma of electrically heated dust coming from the vents of that lustrous wooden console. No matter how many times my mother yelled, "Kevin! Move back before you go blind!" I'd still feel myself powerfully drawn into that world, and the worn-out seats of my Lee jeans bore witness to the pull I was powerless to resist.<br><br>I was instantly taken with this new show, with these creatures called "Muppets"--Jim Henson's trademark way of combining "marionette" and "puppet"--and little did I know that I was already setting the course of my life to exchange my New Pittsburgh Avenue address for 123 Sesame Street. Love makes you do crazy things sometimes.<br>He may not look like it, but that Elmo's a love machine.<br><br>When parents tell me, "My child lives for Elmo," I tell them that Elmo lives because of their child's love for him. I don't just mean that Elmo is alive in their child's imagination, though that is certainly a part of it. That child and Elmo aren't just experiencing love; they're creating more of it to go around, and in doing so they make the world a better place.<br><br>It works like this: Elmo feeds off the love he receives from kids, from the adult characters on the show, and from his fellow Muppets. He doesn't just take that love in as a fuel and use it up. Instead, he drinks it in and gives it right back in spades. He's a kind...</p><h2>Dating Old Photographs 1840-1929</h2><p>You&#39;ve almost certainly faced the problem: you&#39;ve got an album or box of old photographs but almost all lack any identification. Family Chronicle&#39;s special publication can&#39;t help you identify the subject but it can help you with dating when the picture was taken - often within a couple of years. A number of books have already been published that describe how to date old photographs but they rely almost entirely on descriptions: Family Chronicle&#39;s book is almost all reproductions of old photographs of known date. There are over 650 pictures covering the period from the 1840s to the 1920s. By comparing your undated pictures to the examples, you will be able to compare clothing and hair fashion, the poses adopted by the subject and the background settings and establish a date within a couple of years. The book provides convincing evidence that our ancestors were at least as fashion conscious as we are today and that those fashions changed just as frequently.</p><p>The Family Chronicle team is a group of genealogy experts and enthusiasts who came together in September 1996 to produce Family Chronicle, the magazine for families researching their roots. Since the launch of the bi-monthly magazine, Family Chronicle has enjoyed great acclaim and has established itself as a leading magazine for genealogists and family historians. <p>The great success the magazine has enjoyed has lead to the publication of The Family Chronicle Collection and subsequent four Family Chronicle Years (titled Year 2-5 respectively). Each book is a compendium of the articles from each year of Family Chronicle so readers need not miss the best of the magazine. Other book titles include the enormously popular Dating Old Photographs 1840-1929, a proven tool to assist with discovering the dates of undated family photographs, and Family Chronicle's Introduction to Genealogy, an excellent companion to any newcomer to the field of genealogy. </p><p>From the same team also comes History Magazine, which looks at the social history of our ancestors.

The truth is that the typical personal improvement mantra of tapping into your willpower and activating the power of positive thinking is actually a recipe for failure.&nbsp; In <i>Beyond Willpower</i>, bestselling author and psychological counselor Alexander Loyd, PhD, ND, reveals a unique, highly effective program to help you finally achieve the life you want and the success you deserve.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science has proven that stress, or internal fear, is the primary source of virtually any problem we encounter&#x2013; physical, spiritual, emotional, and even circumstantial.&nbsp;New research has shown that fear is literally programmed into us at the cellular level, which is why most of us are unable to turn off our stress response by willpower alone. For the first time, this book teaches you how to change your cellular programming from fear to love, triggering a natural chemical chain reaction that fuels you for your best success.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooted in science, ancient wisdom, and proven therapeutic techniques to remove personal obstacles that sabotage us, <i>Beyond Willpower</i> offers a revolutionary 40-day holistic program based on more than 25 years of clinical experience. With this program you will identify and clarify what fundamentally defines success for you.&nbsp; Then you&#x2019;ll receive the three simple tools you need to internally shift from fear to love physically (using the Energy Medicine tool), mentally (using the Reprogramming Statements tool), and spiritually (using the Heart Screen tool). You'll also have free access to the unprecedented&nbsp;"Success Issues Finder" test, which accurately diagnoses your unconscious and subconscious issues related to success and failure, happiness and unhappiness. No matter how you define success &#x2013; as wealth, career satisfaction, healing of health issues, or resolution of relationship problems &#x2013;<i>Beyond Willpower</i> will help you achieve it once and for all, quickly and for the long term.</p></p><p>Alex Loyd, PhD, ND, holds doctorates in psychology and naturopathic medicine.

"To be sure I lose the fruits of the earth, but then I am gathering the flowers of the sea." Filled with 3,700 entries and covering a span of over 5,000 years, <em>The Oxford Companion to</em> <em>Ships and the Sea</em> offers readers the opportunity to gather also the many flowers of the world's bountiful waters. From the days when man first ventured on the waters in his primitive canoe to the modern age of the nuclear submarine, the hydrofoil, and the ultra large crude oil carriers of half a million tons, this comprehensive <em>Companion</em> brings together the immense field of marine terminology in one easily accessible volume.<br> International in scope, the <em>Companion</em> ranges from the ships and the men who opened up the world with their voyages into the unknown, through the struggle of nations as they developed and recognized that power and prosperity depended on the excercise of sea power, to those who wrote about and painted the sea scene. And within this wide compass lie all sorts of maritime specialties such as the changing designs of ships to meet particular needs, the huge growth of yachting as modern men and women continue to find more and more delight, relaxation, and challenge in the wide spaces of the sea, and the modern developments in navigation which so greatly simplify the art of finding one's way at sea. Also covered is the rich language of the sea, developed over centuries into a well-recognized and accepted vernacular that binds together seamen of many countries making them a breed whose colorful language quickly identifies their trade. Terms such as mizen-mast (the mast of a square-rigged sailing ship or of a three-masted schooner), bucko'mate (the mate of a sail ship who drove his crew by the power of his fists), and six water grog (a punishment in the British Navy often inflicted on seamen found guilty of neglect or drunkeness in which their daily tot of rum was diluted with six parts of water instead of the normal three) are just a few examples of the sea's unique and diverse language. Definitions, and the derivation where known, are given for most words and terms used everyday at sea, and those which have fallen into disuse through technological development are also included, as they appear so frequently in the literature of the sea. Included as well are helpful appendices on naval ranks, international signal codes, rules of the sea (important lights, daymarks, and fog signals), buoys and buoyage, and equivalents of some common units of measure, making this is an invaluable reference tool for both land and sea.<br> Illustrated throughout, <em>The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea</em> is the definitive reference of the seafaring history of the world. From biographies of those who left their mark upon the sea to accounts of naval battles and histories of famous ships to lore, language, and customs of the sea, this outstanding volume will provide hours of pleasure for all those with a love of the sea and all things nautical.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Kemp</strong> has written widely on naval, military, and yachting subjects.

Fortunately for today's handcrafters, Robin Hansen has searched out the few knitters who still make the old designs or who have reconstructed lost patterns from surviving examples. She tested the patterns, wrote out detailed instructions, and gathered them all in this illlustrated book. Fox &amp; Geese &amp; Fences features complete knitting instructions for eleven designs in sizes ranging from infant to adult.

Raised in a series of foster homes, orphanages and "reform" schools, and viciously abused in each. Two prison terms and a lifetime later, Burke is still an outlaw: an urban survivalist who doesn't exist on paper, working the jagged edges of the criminal underworld. He's a man for hire, but you have to earn the right to trust him. The dark heart of six previous novels by Andrew Vachss - Flood, Strega, Blue Belle, Hard Candy, Blossom and Sacrifice - Burke's earned the title "lord of the asphalt jungle" (Washington Post). And now, after a hiatus of three years, he's back.<br>Still mourning the death of a child whose life he took instead of saved, Burke feels the pull of the Zero - the abyss that lies beyond death. Alone with his sorrow, he's been quiet for a long time when he gets the phone call. It's from a kid named Randy claiming to be the son of a woman Burke once knew, and still owes. The kid's plush Connecticut suburb has been hit with a rash of inexplicable teenage "suicides." He's sure he could be next and he wants a bodyguard. Burke's no professional bullet-catcher, but he goes along for two reasons: Randy's mother did save him a prison stretch years ago. And the kid's neighborhood is lousy with cash.<br>Lousy with other things too. Burke quickly discovers that the picture-perfect community hides the nerve center of an intense erotic underground where S&amp;M sex is sold, traded...and recorded. As Burke moves down the pipeline to where the cluster suicides began, he finds himself in wealthy homes where the term "emotional abuse" takes euphemism to new heights - and depths.<br>And when a beautiful dominatrix with an ugly secret introduces him to a hideous new version of "legal" kiddie porn, Burke's rage drags him back from the Zero's edge and into a shadowy war with barely visible, shape-shifting enemies.<br>Consumed by grave-dancing with his own demons, Burke is quickly cornered. But his trappers are about to discover exactly what kind of quarry they've got...</p><p>einvented detective fiction and, in the person of Burke, his haunted, hell-ridden P.I., has given readers a new kind of hero. Investigating an epidemic of apparent suicides among the teenagers of a wealthy suburb, Burke discovers a sinister connection between the anguish of the young and the activities of an elite sadomasochistic underground.Andrew Vachss is a lawyer who represents children and youths exclusively.

He believes he's found both when he returns home to Seattle only to be swept up in a massive protest. With young, biracial Victor o one side of the barricades and his estranged father--the white chief of police--on the opposite, the day descends into chaos, capturing in its confusion the activists, police, bystanders, and citizens from all around the world who'd arrived that day brimming with hope. By the day's end, they have all committed acts they never thought possible. <br><br>As heartbreaking as it is pulse-pounding, Yapa's virtuosic debut asks profound questions about the power of empathy in our hyper-connected modern world, and the limits of compassion, all while exploring how far we must go for family, for justice, and for love.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2016:</strong> Coursing with energy, Sunil Yapa&#x2019;s <em>Your Heart is a Muscle the Size of a Fist</em> is a rocket ship of a book, filled with heroics, violence and the propulsive action of a heart. Over the course of a day, Yapa spools a narrative of the now infamous World Trade Organization protests that took place along the streets of Seattle in 1990--a day that started peacefully and ended in blood. Yapa&#x2019;s world introduces you to a kaleidoscope of characters and each is raw, real, driven by their own obligation and role in the protests&#x2014;from the Chief of Police whose city it is to protect, to an ardent non-violent activist, to a delegate making his way to an important meeting in the hopes of transforming his country.

Confidential</h2><p>1951, Los Angeles. 6 prisoners are beaten senseless in their cells by cops crazed on alcohol. For the three LAPD detectives involved, it will expose the guilty secrets on which they have built their corrupt and violent careers... (from the back wrapper)</p><p>James Ellroy's <i>L.A. Confidential</i> is film-noir crime fiction akin to <i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Hollywood Babylon</i>, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and Jim Thompson. It's about three tortured souls in the 1950s L.A.P.D.: Ed Exley, the clean-cut cop who lives shivering in the shadow of his dad, a legendary cop in the same department; Jack Vincennes, a cop who advises a <i>Police Squad</i>- like TV show and busts movie stars for payoffs from sleazy <i>Hush-Hush</i> magazine; and Bud White, a detective haunted by the sight of his dad murdering his mom. <p> Ellroy himself was traumatized as a boy by his party-animal mother's murder. (See his memoir <i>My Dark Places</i> for the whole sordid story.) So it is clear that Bud is partly autobiographical. But Exley, whose shiny reputation conceals a dark secret, and Vincennes, who goes showbiz with a vengeance, reflect parts of Ellroy, too.</p> <p> <i>L.A. Confidential</i> holds enough plots for two or three books: the cops chase stolen gangland heroin through a landscape littered with not-always-innocent corpses while succumbing to sexy sirens who have been surgically resculpted to resemble movie stars; a vile developer--based (unfairly) on Walt Disney-- schemes to make big bucks off Moochie Mouse; and the cops compete with the crooks to see who can be more corrupt and violent. Ellroy's hardboiled prose is so compressed that some of his rat-a-tat paragraphs are hard to follow. You have to read with attention as intense as his�and that is very intense indeed. But he richly rewards the effort. He may not be as deep and literary as Chandler, but he belongs on the same top-level shelf.</p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Modern Masterworks, Bk 2</h2><p>These books present captivating 20th-century works that are fresh, upbeat and sure to motivate.

As a survivor of the Holocaust and a life-long proponent of free expression, Soros understands the meaning of freedom. And yet his differences with George Bush, another proponent of freedom, are profound.<p> In this powerful essay Soros spells out his views and how they differ from the president's. He reflects on why the Democrats may have lost the high ground on these values issues and how they might reclaim it.

This year Harry turns 14 and becomes interested in girls -- one in particular. And with Dark Magic comes danger, as someone close to Harry dies. You'll have to listen to learn more! The audio is available on July 8th.</p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language." Saturday Review </p><p>"A major psychological and cultural event of our time." Psychology Today </p><p>"One is immediately forced to use one's mind in a new way." New York Times </p><p>The instrumental function of Shah's work is now well established among people from all walks of life. Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary". </p><p>"It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure." Robert Ornstein, Ph.D. </p><p>"Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers." Thomas Malone, MIT </p><p>"Idries Shah provides the unique perspective that allows us to assess real motivations and social biases in a more accurate light." E. Neilsen, Attorney at Law</p><p>Virtually all organizations known to you work largely by means of your greed. They attract you because what they say or do appeals to your greed. This is concealed only by their appearance. If you stop listening to their words and look at the effect, you will soon see it. </p><p>Remember that greed includes greed for being not greedy. So, if someone says: "Do not be greedy, be generous", you may inwardly interpret this in such a manner that you will develop a greed for generosity. This, however, remains greed.</p></p><h2>Necessity: A Novel (Thessaly, 3)</h2><p><p><b>2017 Sunburst Award for Adult Fiction Finalist</b></p><p><b><i>Necessity: </i>the sequel to the acclaimed <i>The Just City</i> and <i>The Philosopher Kings</i>, Jo Walton's tales of gods, humans, and what they have to learn from one another.</b></p><p>More than sixty-five years ago, Pallas Athena founded the Just City on an island in the eastern Mediterranean, placing it centuries before the Trojan War, populating it with teachers and children from throughout human history, and committing it to building a society based on the principles of Plato's <i>Republic.</i> Among the City's children was Pytheas, secretly the god Apollo in human form.</p><p>Sixty years ago, the Just City schismed into five cities, each devoted to a different version of the original vision.</p><p>Forty years ago, the five cities managed to bring their squabbles to a close. But in consequence of their struggle, their existence finally came to the attention of Zeus, who can't allow them to remain in deep antiquity, changing the course of human history. Convinced by Apollo to spare the Cities, Zeus instead moved everything on the island to the planet Plato, circling its own distant sun.</p><p>Now, more than a generation has passed. The Cities are flourishing on Plato, and even trading with multiple alien species. Then, on the same day, two things happen. Pytheas dies as a human, returning immediately as Apollo in his full glory. And there's suddenly a human ship in orbit around Plato--a ship from Earth.</p></p><p>JO WALTON won the Hugo and Nebula Awards in 2012 for her novel <i>Among Others</i>. Before that, her novel <i>Tooth and Claw</i> won the World Fantasy Award in 2004. A native of Wales, Walton lives in Montreal."A trilogy which began as an almost-dry intellectual exercise ends as a glorious kitchen sink of genre, combining philosophy, time travel, aliens, and the gods." &#x2015;<b>Kirkus Reviews</b></p><h2>More Pricks Than Kicks</h2><p>Fiction. &#34;More Pricks Than Kicks&#34;, Beckett&#39;s early tragicomic masterpiece, is a collection of stories about Belacqua, a student in Dublin in the twenties, his adventures, encounters and amours, that through its original style and wry commentary succeeds in turning everyday incidents into high drama and lets us see street and university life through the observant and caustic wit of the author. Highly enjoyable to read, it delights in exuberant language and the pleasure of discovery, very typical of the young writer who in the post-war years was to astonish the world with Waiting for Godot and Molloy. First published in 1934, &#34;More Pricks Than Kicks&#34; is Beckett&#39;s second work of fiction. It serves as an excellent introduction to the later work of one of the most seminal and exciting major writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and graduated from Trinity College. He settled in Paris in 1937, after travels in Germany and periods of residence in London and Dublin. He remained in France during the Second World War and was active in the French Resistance. From the spring of 1946 his plays, novels, short fiction, poetry and criticism were largely written in French. With the production of En attendant Godot in Paris in 1953, Beckett&#39;s work began to achieve widespread recognition. During his subsequent career as a playwright and novelist in both French and English he redefined the possibilities of prose fiction and writing for the theatre. Samuel Beckett won the Prix Formentor in 1961 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. He died in Paris in December 1989.</p><h2>Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)</h2><p><b>Some Days, It Doesn't Pay To Get Out Of Bed</b><p>That's what crosses Clint Evans's mind the minute he takes on the four thugs holding heiress Julie Rose hostage. It isn't the danger that has Clint in a lather, but Julie herself. The pretty, petite schoolteacher he's been hired to return to her wealthy fianc� is no fainting trust-fund baby. She's more of a hellcat, one who won't be deterred when she sets her sights on something. And her sights are set on Clint.</p><p>The one rule Clint never breaks is this--don't get involved with the client. He can look, but he definitely cannot touch--even if it's driving him crazy. Keeping Julie safe until he can figure out who's behind her kidnapping means never letting her out of his sight. And the closer he sticks to the feisty, seductive woman who makes him feel alive...the harder it gets for him to ever consider letting her go...</p><p>"Foster writes smart, sexy, engaging characters."--Christine Feehan</p><p>"A Lori Foster book is like a glass of good champagne--sexy and sparkling."--Jayne Ann Krentz</p></p><p>Lori Foster is the <b>New York Times</b> and <b>USA Today</b> bestselling author of many contemporary romances.Clint Evans is a kind of repo man. The dangerous kind. For a fee Clint will retrieve things that have been stolen or people who have been kidnapped, even if he has to stretch the law to the breaking point. Julie Rose has been kidnapped, taken to a secluded hunting cabin, manhandled, abused, and threatened with rape.

Cromwell rules the land now. The family home has been burnt and they are supposed to have died in the flames.</p><p>Captain Frederick Marryat (1792-1848) was an English novelist, a contemporary and acquaintance of Charles Dickens, noted today as an early pioneer of the sea story. He is now known particularly for the semi-autobiographical novel Mr Midshipman Easy and his children&#39;s novel The Children of the New Forest, and for a widely used system of maritime flag signalling.Set in seventeenth-century England during King Charles&#39;s deposition, this story features four orphaned children who are adopted by a forester. He has rescued them from the &#34;Roundhead&#34; troops who killed their Royalist father (loyal to King Charles). As the forester&#39;s adopted &#34;grandchildren,&#34; the four Beverly children must adapt to rustic life, learning to cook, hunt, and sew. Narrator Glen McCready&#39;s details these activities with a quiet pleasure that is contagious. McCready&#39;s dignified British voice is well suited to this old-fashioned adventure story filled with the classic themes of resourcefulness, self-reliance, and courage. As McCready&#39;s narration skillfully illuminates the children&#39;s growing maturity and wisdom, the story becomes all the more satisfying.

In 1965 at the height of a successful career as an abstract painter in Paris and New York he suddenly stopped painting to return to drawing from life in order to assuage a &#39;violent hunger in the eye&#39; released by his experience of the great Caravaggio exhibition of that year. When he returned to painting in 1973 it was to begin on the series of intensely observed portraits, nudes and still lifes for which he is now known world wide. His intimate still lifes include such &#39;local&#39; subjects as a bundle of asparagus, a corner of his Paris studio and the books on his library shelves. His portraits range from informal studies of his close friends the playwright Samuel Beckett and the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson to striking portrayals of public figures, among them the former British Prime Minister Lord Home and the Queen Mother. This book, based on interviews with the artist, surveys Arikha&#39;s entire career and shows his work from the drawings he made as a child in a Nazi concentration camp to the passionately observed and beautifully composed paintings of the last five years.

She&nbsp;lives and works in California.<p><b>Family Camping Trip #2</b></p><i>&nbsp;</i><p><i>Why????</i> we all asked when my father broke the news. A family disappearance/corporate retreat/camping trip all rolled up into one. <i>Surely</i> it was a bad idea, I suggested. The sentiment was reaffirmed by Rae with her constant references to the Donner Party and repeated inquiries as to which one of the Spellmans plus guest would most likely be consumed first (should it come to that). The third time this particular line of inquiry rolled around, my mother sent Rae to her room.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>If all of this is confusing you, perhaps I should give you a quick refresher course on the Spellmans. Although I highly recommend reading the first three documents[1] if you want a true understanding of what is really going on here.</p><p>My father is Albert Spellman, a onetime cop turned private investigator who really likes lunch. He is happily married to Olivia Spellman, my mother and co-owner of Spellman Investigations. Mom is an extremely attractive woman--although lately people have been adding the disclaimer &#x201c;for her age,&#x201d; which has started to get under her skin. Other than my mom&#x2019;s mild vanity, her most obscene characteristic is that she seems to think meddling in her children&#x2019;s lives is an Olympic event. Her training regimen is positively brutal.&nbsp; </p><p>Albert and Olivia have three children. The oldest, my brother David, 34: Formerly a poster-boy for the all-American corporate male, currently an out-of-work human being. I&#x2019;m the middle child. Isabel, 32, if you didn&#x2019;t catch it already. My M.O. from fifth grade until my mid-twenties was that of the problem child. The &#x201c;student&#x201d; who the principal knew by name, the neighbors feared and the pot dealers counted on to stay afloat. Also, in the interest of honesty, there were a few arrests thrown into the mix--two (or four depending on how you&#x2019;re counting) as recently as two years ago, which I guess means that I can&#x2019;t argue that my problem years were confined to my youth or even my twenties. But it&#x2019;s important to note that I&#x2019;ve come a long way. Therapy helped, and I&#x2019;m big enough to admit it was court-ordered. </p><p>About six months ago, after years of doubt about my future with Spellman Investigations, I committed to the job completely and agreed to slowly begin taking over the business from my parents so they can retire and learn to macram�[2] or something. My father likes to say the seeds of adulthood have been planted. He&#x2019;s just waiting for them to take. </p><p>There&#x2019;s only one other Spellman to speak of&#x2014;Rae&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll mostly let her speak for herself because you might not believe me otherwise. </p><p>I suppose the most defining characteristic of my family is that we take our work home with us. If your job is investigating other people, you inevitably investigate each other. This single trait has been our primary point of conflict for most of my life. </p><p>Finally, to round out the players on this unfortunate camping trip, I should mention Maggie. Maggie Mason, girlfriend to brother David. Maggie is a defense attorney who used to date Henry Stone (that&#x2019;s a whole other story I don&#x2019;t really want to get into right now, okay?) who happens to be the &#x201c;best friend&#x201d;[3] of my now seventeen-year-old sister, the briefly aforementioned Rae. Henry is a forty-five-year-old police inspector and Rae is a senior in high school. They&#x2019;re an unlikely duo. Rae met Henry when she was fourteen and I guess she decided that they were kindred spirits. However, on the surface (and beneath the surface) they have nothing in common. At the start, Henry endured Rae. Then he got used to her. Then, when Henry was dating Maggie and Rae went to supernatural lengths to sabotage their relationship, Henry cut Rae off completely. Now they have found peace. At least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve heard. I don&#x2019;t get involved anymore.</p><p>After Maggie and Henry broke up, over half of the Spellman clan vetted Maggie and determined that she was a quality human, the kind of person that the Spellman circle sorely needed. After an appropriate amount of time passed, the matchmaking plans for Maggie and David were successfully enacted. The couple had only been together about two months at the point of this camping trip, but since Maggie is the only person we know who can make fire from a flint, pitch a tent, use a compass and actually owns bear spray, we thought it wise for our own personal safety to bring her along. That and David refused to come unless she accompanied him.</p><p>Now picture me in the pre-dawn hours, in the middle of the woods, in the middle of the Russian River, in the middle of nowhere, sharing a tent with my much younger sister, Rae, who had spent the past two days either trying to get cell phone reception, complaining about the mosquitoes, or &#x201c;sleeping&#x201d;, during which time she carried on lengthy conversations about. . . well, honestly I couldn&#x2019;t tell you. I caught phrases like: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been sworn to secrecy,&#x201d; &#x201c;Not in this lifetime,&#x201d; and &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll find the treasure at the bottom of the gorge.&#x201d; I might have been able to sleep through her babbling if she weren&#x2019;t a nighttime thrasher and kicker. And so, once again, there I was, sleep-deprived, trapped with family, waiting for the nightmare to come to an end. My life in a nutshell.</p><p>I gave up on sleep, knowing that this was my last full day in the wild. When I exited my tent, my father was trying to make coffee and failing miserably. He appeared glad for company since my mother was still slumbering in their tent. <b></b></p><p>&#x201c;What am I doing wrong?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Strong-arming your family into a cruel and unnecessary nature excursion,&#x201d; I suggested.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>No</i>,&#x201d; Dad replied. &#x201c;What am I doing wrong with the coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t stick the coffee in the pot and boil it with the water, Dad. Are you brain-dead? You just boil the water first and use the French press Maggie brought. Weren&#x2019;t you watching her yesterday?&#x201d; I replied with too much hostility.</p><p>My father tried to lighten the mood with the only joke he had in his arsenal this weekend.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take a hike?&#x201d; he said for about the thirtieth time.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to dig a grave for that line and you&#x2019;re going to bury it, Dad. I swear to you if you say it one more time&#x2014;&#x201c;</p><p>&#x201c;Maggie!&#x201d; Dad shouted, with way too much enthusiasm for waking hours. &#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re awake.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie smiled, approached the campfire, and took over the coffee-making. Already the morning had improved. But the purpose of the trip had not yet been realized and, eventually, we had to accept that this wasn&#x2019;t simply a bonding experience for the Spellmans and friend, but something even more bizarre. </p><p>I should mention that no Spellman child had gone AWOL (or refused to participate in the excursion since &#x201c;business&#x201d; was not to take place until the final day and, frankly, we all wanted our voice to be heard, even if it was heard above the buzz of mosquitoes. Also, I should mention that my parents refused to give raises to anyone who didn&#x2019;t participate in this bonding exercise. As for David, he was only there because he thought Maggie needed more quality time with the family, as a kind of cautionary lesson. </p><p>I suppose it&#x2019;s time we get to business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>[1] <i>The Spellman Files, Curse of the Spellmans, Revenge of the Spellmans &#x2013; </i>all available in paperback!</p><p>[2] The parental unit claims to have plans for their retirement, but so far none sound even remotely plausible. </p><p>[3] Her words; not his.</p></p><h2>RightStart Mathematics Level D Lessons - Second Edition</h2><p>The second edition RS2 Level D works on the meaning and properties of multiplication and division, along with the basic facts.

These conflicts are immense and various, singular and commonplace.

Thus every possible human emotion features in the Mahabharata, the reason the epic continues to hold sway over our imagination.

He</i> slept through the wail of the sirens. He slept through the rumble of the Plaza Hanoi across the street imploding. He slept through the strike at the new education ministry a half block away, and the collapse of the Vietnamese Private Commercial Enterprise Bank building a half mile away.<br>Josh MacArthur slept and slept, oblivious to the sounds of the war he had suddenly found himself in, a war that he was not only witness to, but a critical part of. He missed the grating <i>har-ush</i> of the Chinese jets as they roared overhead, the last-minute shriek of the air-to-ground missiles just before they struck, and the steady rattle of the antiaircraft guns, twin-barreled 23mm and the larger 57s and 85s, their shrapnel exploding in an irregular pattern.<br>He missed the glass shattering everywhere, panes breaking like the thin ice over a pond on a late winter&#x2019;s day. He missed the rumble of the gas lines as they blew up, muffled by the ground. He missed the sharp cracks of old wood splintering beneath the weight of collapsing roofs and walls.<br>What woke him was the light touch of her footsteps in the hall, passing in front of his room on the way out.<br>They belonged to the woman who&#x2019;d rescued him, Mara Duncan. Against all odds, the CIA officer had found Josh behind the lines of the Chinese advance and pulled him with her through the jungle, across the hills to a rendezvous with American SEALs, who had brought him to a truck commandeered by two U.S. Army officers. Together, they barely managed to make it past the advancing Chinese troops, but managed nonetheless.<br>The adventure would have been unimaginable for most people. But for Josh MacArthur, a weather scientist of all things, it seemed as unlikely as it could get. Josh had come to Vietnam to study the effects of the weather on the jungle. Instead, he had become a witness to man&#x2019;s more immediate impact on the environment&#x2014;the cold-blooded massacre of a Vietnamese village in the hills by the Chinese.<br>The Chinese had also murdered his own colleagues. He&#x2019;d missed that by chance, complete chance&#x2014;his allergies had woken him and sent him away from the tents, out of concern for his colleagues and their sleep. His sneezing had saved him.<br>He&#x2019;d run when the fighting began. Except that it wasn&#x2019;t fighting; it was a massacre. The scientists and their support staff had been killed in their sleep, without any possibility of resistance.<br>The killers had chased him as well. He&#x2019;d run for his life, lost in the darkness in a country literally halfway around the world from his home.<br>He&#x2019;d been defenseless and alone, and yet running seemed like an act of cowardice, of weakness, as if he might somehow have made a difference.<br>It was a foolish notion&#x2014;the Chinese soldiers outnumbered him greatly, and in fact had barely missed him several times before his rescue. Josh had killed several himself, including one with his bare hands. There was no question, or should be no question, of his bravery.<br>And yet that idea, that feeling of failure, woke with him in the gray light of the Hanoi hotel room.<br>Josh sat upright in the bed. The hotel had never been one of the city&#x2019;s best, nor a favorite with the international tourist crowd. The furnishings had been old and battered well before the war. There was only a pair of bare sheets on the bed. They hadn&#x2019;t been changed in days, not since the war began. Josh had found them covered with dust and small bits of glass from the shattered windows, blown out from the attacks on the first night of the war. Too tired to talk to the staff&#x2014;and guessing it would have been worthless to try&#x2014;he&#x2019;d pushed the small shards off on the floor and simply collapsed in bed a few hours before. Now he found grime stuck to him, held to his skin by his sweat.<br>He put his hands on his chest, gently brushing downward, more to reassure himself that he was still there than to clear the clinging grit.<br>As unglamorous as it was, the hotel was a solid, squat structure, dating from colonial times and overengineered by its French architect. Its sturdy walls had protected it from the shrapnel when the building across the street had collapsed, and while nothing was truly safe against a direct hit by one of the Chinese army&#x2019;s larger weapons, the hotel was one of the safest buildings in the city still open to foreigners. And of course it was obvious that Josh and his friends were foreigners.<br>He swung his legs out of bed. They were creaky and stiff. Josh had considered himself both athletic and in fairly good shape&#x2014;he had taken letters in cross-country and baseball in high school, despite the asthma occasionally provoked by his allergies&#x2014;but his ordeal in the jungle had tested his body. Both knees were sore, his right calf muscle had been pulled, and his neck felt as if it were a bolt twisted too tightly into its socket.<br>Glancing at the gray twilight outside the window, he guessed it was roughly 5 a.m. His watch had been lost during the initial attack.<br>He walked slowly to the door, mindful of the glass. There were small piles of it along the front of the room, which faced a side street away from the hotel that had imploded. Someone had come in and swept the larger pieces into the piles, but neglected to come back and remove them.<br>Or maybe they had been killed before they got the chance. Several thousand civilians had died in Hanoi since the bombing began.<br>Josh undid the lock and pulled open the door. A large man stood in front of him, blocking the door. It was Jenkins, aka Squeaky, one of the SEALs who had rescued him.<br>&#x201c;Hey, sir, where you going?&#x201d; said Squeaky.<br>His nickname was Squeaky because his voice occasionally cracked, jumping a few octaves. He sounded like a teenage boy on bad mornings as his voice begins to deepen. There was no precise pattern to the squeaks; they seemed to occur a little less under pressure, the opposite of what Josh would have expected.<br>Squeaky was a big man, six ten and solidly built, stocky but not fat. He wore a pair of dungarees and a button-down shirt, in the Western style common in Vietnam&#x2019;s urban areas. The clothes were all black; they seemed to merge with his black skin, making him look like a dark spirit haunting the building, a hungry ghost looking for its ancestral offerings, as the local folklore would have it. He had an MP-5 submachine gun, and held it down next to his body discreetly, almost as if he were hiding it.<br>&#x201c;I gotta use the john,&#x201d; said Josh.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk you down.&#x201d;<br>Josh fell in behind him. Squeaky rocked a little as he walked, shoulders nearly scraping the walls.<br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; the SEAL told him when they reached the doorway to the restroom.<br>He poked his head in, then reached back, took Josh&#x2019;s arm, and tugged him in. For a second, Josh thought he was going to stay&#x2014;a problem, since Josh liked privacy&#x2014;but Jenkins was just making doubly sure the place was empty.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be outside.

His latest case finds him drawn into the world of the Roman religious cults and the murder of a member of the Sacred Brotherhoods.</p><p>Marcus Didius Falco is back in another lively first-century historical mystery. The Roman investigator, informer, and imperial spy's snappy patter, romantic leanings, strong sense of irony, and penchant for getting into interesting situations have won Lindsey Davis a growing number of fans. Flush with his earnings from an African adventure (<i>Two for the Lions</i>), Falco's just been rewarded for his service to the empire with an unusual bit of political patronage: he's been appointed to the largely ceremonial position of Procurator of the Sacred Poultry, meaning he's in charge of the care and feeding of a gaggle of sacred geese. This un-Falco-like upward mobility is an opportunity for Marcus to move his patrician wife, Helena Justina, and their toddler out of a tenement and into a home of their own. As much as Marcus scoffs at middle-class pretensions, he's not above leaving his seedy surroundings and providing his family with some of the finer things, if only to show his in-laws that he can. But when Helena's brother falls over a corpse that disappears before it can be identified, Falco tosses the geese some food and gets busy finding the connection between the dead man and a 6-year-old girl who's in line to be chosen as the new vestal virgin. That leads him into intrigue, danger, and a confrontation with a former vestal virgin that almost costs him his life. Well paced, with good dialogue, excellent plotting, and a cast of terrific characters surrounding Falco and Helena, including some familiar from earlier stories, <i>One Virgin Too Many</i> shows Davis in top form. Falco the family man is better company than ever. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Falco returns home to Rome for his eleventh appearance in this highly popular and successful series. As a reward for his Census work Falco has at last been made an equestrian. But imperial favour coupled with his new duties as Procurator of the Sacred Poultry of the Senate and People of Rome bring their own complications. Not only is he now ensconsed in all the trappings of the Establishment and the state religion but Falco also has a troublesome new partner, Aelianus, to deal with. Private and public business merge as he is sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl selected to be a Vestal Virgin. Closely watched by his ex-partner Petronius and the vigilies who are just waiting for him to slip up, Falco is sorely determined to solve this mystery.</p><h2>Naomi&#39;s Breakthrough Guide: 20 Choices to Transform Your Life</h2><p>Naomi Judd is affectionately called the Star Next Door, but she's also a survivor. In <i>Naomi's Breakthrough Guide</i> she shares her hard-won wisdom and outlines twenty important choices that will help readers improve their relationships, family life, career, and even their health. Blending candid personal stories, the science of happiness, and practical exercises with anecdotes about well-known friends and family, <i>Naomi's Breakthrough Guide</i> is an essential companion and guide for anyone seeking to turn potential breakdowns into life-altering breakthroughs.</p><p>"How in the world have I survived all the broken heart attacks, whacks and setbacks?" asks country music superstar Naomi Judd. Her answers are found in <i>Naomi's Breakthrough Guide</i>, a description of 20 choices that helped her overturn the "death sentence" of a diagnosis of hepatitis C. In a buoyant supportive voice, Judd interprets mind-body research about healing in her own terms. This creates a foundation for her two central ideas: Our predicaments are the result of our choices. The way we choose to react to what happens to us (whether a life-threatening illness, an addiction, or an unhealthy relationship) allows us to "find the sacred meaning of everything that happens to us." Judd's personal stories are, by turns, charming, feisty and insightful. But she has also done her homework to create a portrait of the "survivor personality." She uses birth-order studies to talk about family conflict and neurochemistry research to explain the role of emotions in building a healthy immune system. Judd explores goal setting, money managing, risk taking, healthy eating and loving relationships with her change-your-mind-to-change-your-world approach. The dark side of her optimism is the arguable contrast of victim/volunteer: implying that we are wholly responsible for our illness and recovery. In addition, few readers will have a superstar's resources (including access to physicians and the love and songs of thousands of fans). But Judd's generous gifts of knowledge and wise kindness offer many treasures. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i><b>Naomi Judd,</b> a country music superstar as well as one of the most admired women in the entertainment industry, has sold more than twenty million albums and won six Grammys and American Music Awards.

Exploring the tangled notions of masculinity, femininity, beauty, and sex that characterize our cinematic imagination&#x2014;and drawing on examples that range from advertising to pornography, <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> to <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>&#x2014;Thomson illuminates how film as art, entertainment, and business has historically been a polite cover for a kind of erotic s�ance. In so doing, he casts the art and the artists we love in a new light, and reveals how film can both expose the fault lines in conventional masculinity and point the way past it, toward a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a person with desires.</p><p>David Thomson is the author of <i>The Biographical Dictionary of Film</i>, <i>Moments That Made the Movies</i>, <i>The Whole Equation</i>, and the pioneering novel <i>Suspects</i>, which was peopled with characters from film. He lives in San Francisco.<b>Excerpted from <i>Sleeping with Strangers</i></b><br><br>For much of his life, Cary Grant was under siege: he was forever imprisoned by the fa�ade of &#x201c;being Cary Grant.&#x201d; How hard it would be to put himself on true trial with other, new people. He could not really find <i>new </i>people or anyone for whom he was new. They felt they knew him already. So he was barred from the secrecy or privacy so many of us treasure in sexual encounters. We long to believe in the special recess where sexual curiosity may find us. It&#x2019;s one reason why sexual encounters are so often accompanied by immense, passionate talk between the selves unlocked. We are like Clyde Barrow: we want to hear our story told. That can make a precious feeling of something inviolably intimate being shared as it has never been before. <br><br> That may prove wishful thinking or a delusion later. But for people always on show, for show people, it can be a dream that is never satised. How could Cary Grant feel discovered, as opposed to being compared with &#x201c;Cary Grant&#x201d;? How could he or anyone else feel that some precious being had been arrived at? Isn&#x2019;t there the creeping air of being a fake and a failure, as brilliant and bereft an entertainer as a whore playing yourself? <br><br> So movie people may give up the ghost on their secret identity as romantic beings. That is not so far from the self-loathing that some heroic actors feel when they are esteemed for rites of courage and physical prowess they cannot claim as their own. A kind of contempt can develop&#x2014;that or an exaggerated and even cruel insistence on their own virtuous violence. Sex and bravery can be filled with paranoia&#x2014;and in turn that leads some of our great romantic icons to feel a desperate unease with themselves. Cary Grant could never be satisfied with anyone&#x2019;s belief in him. So a kind of mockery emerges: it could seem witty and sophisticated, but it might feel gay, too. <br><br> We&#x2019;re only talking about Grant because that look of his is so particular and so enigmatic. We are watching the difficulty of deciding about him, and surely he knows this. Grant is not lazy or casual; the closer you look, the more there is to see. <br><br> If you want one example of that, go to Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Notorious </i>(1946), which involves a tortured love affair between Grant (as Devlin, a government agent) and Ingrid Bergman (as Alicia Huberman, whose family history places her on the edge of Nazi circles). The film is famous for a prolonged kissing scene between the stars as stealthy as it is erotic. That Grant had no difficulty playing straight. The actresses he worked with never seemed impeded or dismayed. But the narrative situation keeps Devlin suspicious of Alicia, and even cold toward her, as he sets her up for a perilous investigation of a Nazi conspiracy. Jealousy has seldom been done better. Thus Devlin gets her to marry a chief suspect, Alex Sebastian (very well played by Claude Rains). That jeopardizes their love and even threatens her life. <br><br> In the end, Devlin rescues Alicia, carrying her out of a house of evil and poison. Their love comes through, but uncertainty and a kind of cruelty linger in <i>Notorious. </i>These lovers may never forget the sense of falling in love and then of just falling. In a film about trust and vulnerability, <i>Notorious </i>depends on the anguished desire in its central faces. Once you&#x2019;ve registered that, the unease does not easily leave you. The happy ending the film provides is for suckers. <br><br> This is acting; it is professional. In the riddle of performance, Devlin&#x2019;s face has to be Grant&#x2019;s. I cannot link <i>Notorious </i>to proven details of Grant&#x2019;s private life, but another reference is available, and it is more cogent. Archie Leach the child lived with his mum and dad in an ordinary house in Bristol. There had been an older brother who died at the age of one. Then one day, when he was nine, the boy came home from school and his mum was not there with his tea. Archie waited. Dad came home and said the situation was a puzzler. The boy&#x2019;s mother, Elsie Leach, did not come home. Archie was told she had gone away&#x2014;and deserted them. She never went back to that home again. <br><br> Archie grew up. In time, his dad found another woman. The kid joined the music hall; he went to America; he became Cary Grant; he got into movies. It was a tough training, much of it in knockabout physical comedy&#x2014;he was raised a goofball. But the lowly Bristol boy became an epitome of grace and charm for the wide world. One day in 1935 in Beverly Hills he got a letter from a solicitor in Bristol regretting to tell him his father had died. According to the solicitor, there were a few formalities to be tidied up. But one question was out of the ordinary or presented uncertainty: what was to be done with Elsie? Long ago she had been lodged in an asylum in Bristol, the Glenside Hospital, a place that Archie would have seen often without ever thinking about it. <br><br> Grant went back to Bristol as soon as he could. With surprising ease he was able to get his mother out of the asylum; it was plain that his father had placed her there, with some connivance from doctors, to suit his own situation. Elsie never returned to the asylum. She and the long-lost Archie did their best to repair their relationship. It would never be strong or relaxed. Elsie may not have been disabled, but that does not mean she was other than disturbed after nearly two decades being confined. She felt betrayed. Grant was horrified at what had happened, and he would admit later in life that he seldom found emotional comfort with his mother (she died in 1973, aged ninety-four). Had he let her down? Had he been deserted or deceived? Let&#x2019;s just say that Grant&#x2019;s trust and security were in ruins, and that can be a vital impulse for acting. <br><br> This is not a plea for sympathy&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no need to plead with these extraordinary circumstances&#x2014;or a hope of explaining Cary Grant in any thorough or clinical way. I remain uncertain as to whether he was homosexual for a time in his life. And there is no reason to look down on that possibility or to argue that it might have been forgivable under his circumstances. Gayness does not need forgiveness&#x2014;or explanation. There is ample reason to believe Grant was upset, disturbed, or damaged&#x2014;whatever word you want to use&#x2014;and thus all the more driven to seem smooth, urbane, and in control. Often enough in life, he would say, &#x201c;I wish I could be Cary Grant.&#x201d; That line got a laugh, especially in the <i>Evening with Cary Grant </i>stage shows he did in his last years and which were never filmed. But the wistfulness speaks to the way actors can feel overwhelmed by the popular image of themselves built up in a successful career. Isn&#x2019;t that how Roy Fitzgerald felt dismayed or displaced by the looming figure of &#x201c;Rock Hudson&#x201d;? <br><br> My history of watching Grant suggests that every possible meaning (and then others not thought of) should be recognized in his smile and his bleaker stare. He is not simply heterosexual in the breathless <i>His Girl Friday, </i>where he treats his ex-wife and his wife-to-be (both of them Rosalind Russell) with a furious, competitive cunning that manages to be beguiling and alarming as well as comic. He only once came close to playing a gay character, but that Cole Porter was not allowed to be his homosexual self in the foolish and sanitized <i>Night and Day. </i>With magnificent aplomb he let a blue-chiffon Grace Kelly kiss him in <i>To Catch a Thief, </i>like a judge hired to award marks to a skater. His elegance was so underplayed it could seem introverted. He reached pathos in <i>Penny Serenade </i>and <i>None but the Lonely Heart. </i>He was acrobatic in <i>Holiday, </i>hilarious in <i>Bringing Up Baby </i>and <i>The Awful Truth, </i>and plain old perfect &#x201c;Cary Grant&#x201d; in <i>North by Northwest, </i>where he has giddy erotic scenes with Eva Marie Saint, if you recognize that talking can be as sensual as touching. He enlarged our sense of what a gentleman might be, and surely that involved an understanding of femininity. <br><br> Despite his ambiguity, most Grant plots settled on his good nature and happy-ever-after prospects. But in one film we are shaken by his unreliability. Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Suspicion </i>(1941) was meant to be the story of Lina (Joan Fontaine), an heiress wooed and then murdered by a scoundrel con named Johnnie Aysgarth who will eventually ascend the staircase to her room bearing a glass of milk glowing with poison. <br><br> That great shot remains, but Hitch had to drop the ending for reasons of commercial reassurance, telling us instead that Lina&#x2019;s suspicion had come from mere misunderstanding. (Hitch thought this escape clause was &#x201c;deadly.&#x201d;) Johnny and Lina are going to be &#x201c;all right.&#x201d; Fontaine won an Oscar, but Grant was far more deserving: fiendish, gleeful, mercilessly cold, perpetually dishonest&#x2014;almost for its own sake&#x2014;and curiously attached to an English idiot chum (played by Nigel Bruce). You don&#x2019;t have to be too alert to see that Johnny is horrified by women. He&#x2019;s not obviously gay, but Grant comes close to the devil. Hitchcock quietly exploited the fact that Grant did not like Joan Fontaine&#x2014;we feel it. His Johnny cries out for a full film beyond Hitchcock&#x2019;s cautious pact between box-office and bourgeois restraint. Still, Grant makes Aysgarth the most disturbing man Hitch ever put on film, and good old Cary understood the part. <br><br> There was more in Grant than Scotty Bowers noticed. Who knows where future biographies of the man will go or how much more evidence there can be? And who can deny but that, as a screen actor, he reassessed the entire possibility of what an attractive man might be. I knew an old lady once who assessed some men as &#x201c;dead attractive&#x201d;&#x2014;that was Grant. There was something fatal in him. <br><br> I doubt he was ever simply happy&#x2014;except perhaps when he saw Jennifer watching him. I talked to Grant a little near the end of his life and I was surprised to discover how uneasy or anxious he was. He was afraid of not getting the point, like a lot of eighty-year-olds. My guess is that a crucial part of his development was in his time with Betsy Drake, the least mentioned of his marriages, though it was the one that lasted longest. <br><br> Betsy Drake was born in Paris in 1923 to a wealthy family: her grandfather had founded the Drake Hotel in Chicago. She met Grant in 1947. They fell in love as fellow passengers on the <i>Queen Mary </i>and acted together in two modest films, <i>Every Girl Should Be Married </i>(1948) and <i>Room for One More </i>(1952). She was seldom relaxed on screen. They were married in 1949 and seem to have been happy for several years, until he had an affair with Sophia Loren during the making of <i>The Pride and the Passion </i>(a 1957 film that might have had no other purpose). But that came just as Drake had written a script for Grant&#x2019;s next film, <i>Houseboat, </i>in which she thought she was set to play the lead. Grant then dropped Drake from the project, ordered a new script, and cast Loren instead&#x2014;though she soon went on and married the producer Carlo Ponti, who would star her in <i>Two Women, </i>for which she won the Best Actress Oscar. <br><br> That bitter episode exposed some selfishness or spite in Grant. The couple were only divorced in 1962. She later laughed at the suggestion that he had been bisexual. They were having sex so much, she said, there was no time to consider whether he was gay. That remark may have been meant as wit and fun, and it meets both tests. But it can have a deeper meaning: that all across the nation there are mixed couples, married or not, who make love as a way of warding off awkward and insoluble questions about who they are, or might be. <br><br> Who are we, and who do we want to be? We have been raised to assume that straight sex is an urge and an instinct, a birthright and an identity. But it could be a safety net, a kind of Bunbury for those of us with uncertainties. Doing that, the thing, doing it, vigorously, happily, regularly, may be a way of denying critical thought or the capacity for other things, for anything. <br><br> After divorcing Grant, Drake studied at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and got a degree in education from Harvard, and she wrote a novel. She may have been the most valuable companion in his life, until his daughter arrived. Grant would say the LSD excursions she encouraged cleared up several of his emotional problems. People want to believe in such &#x201c;healing&#x201d;: they say they are cured or better or whole, while being on their way to disintegration and death. Equally, we have passed through the grotesque era in which sane and benevolent practitioners believed in aversion therapy, hypnosis, or simple castration as ways of &#x201c;curing&#x201d; homosexual tendencies. By now, we know that it&#x2019;s that &#x201c;benevolence&#x201d; that needs to be treated. <br><br> When I talked to Cary Grant he was a slipstream of eighty-year-old ease and sophistication, on stage. He still looked like &#x201c;Cary Grant.&#x201d; But in person he was consumed in unease and anxiety. I suspect he had always acted to escape that panic and in the process he carried so many of us closer to imaginary comfort. We should thank him. <br><br> Betsy Drake died in 2015. I don&#x2019;t know whether she left any writing about Grant, but who in his life had a better chance of clarifying his unease? Not that that would have settled every question in his gaze or his rueful, edgy presence. But those things amount to art and they are still there for anyone ready to enjoy his films and their uncertainty. <br><br> It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether Grant was gay or not. That is the mixed signal or recommendation he left for history. The films are more valuable than the question; they are even an answer to surpass the question. The other day, Scott Eyman, who is setting out on a Grant biography, asked me, &#x201c;Would a gay man really marry five times?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a fair point: whatever else, Grant had great hopes for marriage&#x2014;who can claim more than that? The historian in me admits &#x201c;not proven,&#x201d; but the film watcher feels the answer is transparent. That uncertainty over Grant&#x2019;s nature may become a verdict on more and more of us.<br><br> Five marriages, or more? Is that being crazy for wives or a dread of loneliness? The longer I look at Grant, the more I realize that &#x201c;good looking&#x201d; requires our closest attention. It seems he was ready to be anyone, and that&#x2019;s where the life of an actor educates our efforts to live up to the new roles change has made available for us. That sounds exciting, but it may be intimidating: a part of us still feels acting up is being dishonest or &#x201c;not true to oneself.&#x201d;</p><h2>L.A.

On the one hand, we still were not fully rested from our trip to Uganda that had ended just three days earlier. On the other hand, we were energized with anticipation of the interview that would soon take place. My research assistant, Stuart Swicegood, had worked very hard to find the people we would soon meet. A former Mormon couple, Dennis and Rauni Higley, would be waiting to tell us about their amazing pilgrimage from Mormonism to faith in Jesus Christ. The connection in Atlanta went without a hitch. We arrived late at a hotel in downtown Salt Lake City, and sleep came quickly. In what seemed like the blink of an eye, we were getting ready the next morning to travel to the Higleys&#39; home in a suburb of Salt Lake City. A cloudless day with a bright blue sky greeted us as we left the hotel. We both breathed in the fresh air and felt the warmth of the mild spring day. If the weather was to be a sign of the hours ahead, the day would be good indeed. My wife and I discussed our strategy for this interview---the first for this book---because we wanted to be ready for any contingency. I had a list of numerous questions I would be prepared to ask. Nellie Jo would keep the conversation going smoothly in the event that the discussion came to a lull. The fifteen-minute drive to Sandy, Utah, was filled with constant conversation and the occasional interruption of the navigation computer in the rental car. I commented to Nellie Jo that every navigation system I used had a female voice, and I wondered why. My bride of twenty-seven years did not respond verbally, but her smile said it all. As we pulled into the driveway of the Higley home, I looked at the mountains framing their home and neighborhood. The scene was postcard perfect. A sign on the door of their home told us of a Finnish custom that asked all guests to remove their shoes. We rang the doorbell and were quickly greeted by a smiling couple. Rauni Higley welcomed us with an accent that I did not recognize immediately. She would soon tell us that her native homeland was Finland. Her husband, Dennis, was a native of Idaho. Nellie Jo has a clear Alabama accent, and I have been told that I speak with a mix of midwestern twang and southern drawl. The interview recording of the four of us would prove to be a cacophony of voices! Rauni&#39;s Story Rauni and Dennis led us into their impeccably clean home, and we made ourselves comfortable. The digital recorder was set. After some introductory and casual conversation, I asked the first interview question: &#39;Tell us about your background.&#39; I got the impression that Rauni could not wait to talk, so we all looked at her for the first response. &#39;I was born in Finland. My father died when I was eleven, and my mother died when I was seventeen. My grandparents had also passed away. I was an only child, so I was left with no family, just some aunts and uncles,&#39; she told us with a pause. We could tell that the years since their deaths had not removed all her pain. Rauni continued, &#39;I met a young lady who had joined the Mormon Church about a year earlier. She found out about all the deaths in my family, and she explained how my parents, grandparents, and I could be sealed together for eternity. She told me that through the Mormon Church I could get all my family back when this life is over.&#39; There was little need to persuade Rauni further. &#39;I didn&#39;t have any spiritual foundations,&#39; she told us. &#39;They told me that everyone who had not heard the Mormon gospel would get a second chance after death. The names of my parents and grandparents could be taken to the temple, and they could be baptized. It all sounded so great to me.&#39; Mormons became Rauni&#39;s family as she joined their church in 1963. &#39;I met with a small group in an apartment. It was a really nice and friendly group of people. We all called each other &#39;brother and sister.&#39; I never had a brother or sister, and I had no family,&#39; she explained. Rauni became an enthusiastic Mormon. &#39;I read everything in Finland published by the Mormon Church. I read the Book of Mormon right away. I didn&#39;t detect any errors in it because I was not that familiar with the Bible. So it sounded just like the Bible to me.&#39;</p><h2>Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites (The Scott and Laurie Oki Series in Asian American Studies)</h2><p><i>Confinement and Ethnicity</i> documents in unprecedented detail the various facilities in which persons of Japanese descent living in the western United States were confined during World War II: the fifteen &#x201c;assembly centers&#x201d; run by the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Wartime Civil Control Administration, the ten &#x201c;relocation centers&#x201d; created by the War Relocation Authority, and the internment camps, penitentiaries, and other sites under the jurisdiction of the Justice and War Departments. Originally published as a report of the Western Archeological and Conservation Center of the National Park Service, it is now reissued in a corrected edition, with a new Foreword by Tetsuden Kashima, associate professor of American ethnic studies at the University of Washington.<br><br>Based on archival research, field visits, and interviews with former residents, <i>Confinement and Ethnicity</i> provides an overview of the architectural remnants, archeological features, and artifacts remaining at the various sites. Included are numerous maps, diagrams, charts, and photographs. Historic images of the sites and their inhabitants -- including several by Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams -- are combined with photographs of present-day settings, showing concrete foundations, fence posts, inmate-constructed drainage ditches, and foundations and parts of buildings, as well as inscriptions in Japanese and English written or scratched on walls and rocks. The result is a unique and poignant treasure house of information for former residents and their descendants, for Asian American and World War II historians, and for anyone interested in the facts about what the authors call these &#x201c;sites of shame.&#x201d;</p><p><p>A corrected edition of the remarkable government report documenting the facilities in which Japanese Americans were confined during World War II</p>HISUS</p><h2>Leviathan - Revised Edition (Broadview Editions)</h2><p><p> Thomas Hobbes&#x2019;s <em>Leviathan</em> is the greatest work of political philosophy in English and the first great work of philosophy in English. Beginning with premises that were sometimes controversial, such as that every human action is caused by the agent&#x2019;s desire for his own good, Hobbes derived shocking conclusions, such as that the civil government enjoys absolute control over its citizens and that the sovereign has the right to determine which religion is to be practiced in a commonwealth. Hobbes&#x2019;s contemporaries recognized the power of arguments in <em>Leviathan</em> and many of them wrote responses to it; selections by John Bramhall, Robert Filmer, Edward Hyde, George Lawson, William Lucy, Samuel Pufendorf, and Thomas Tenison are included in this edition. </p> <p> <em>Leviathan </em>is divided into four parts: In the first part, Of Man, Hobbes presents a view of human beings and of the natural world in general that is materialistic and mechanistic. In the second part, Of Commonwealth, he defends the theory of absolute sovereignty, the view that the government has all the political power and has the right to control any aspect of life. In the third part, Of a Christian Commonwealth, he critiques concepts like revelation, prophets, and miracles in such a way that it becomes doubtful whether they can be rationally justified. In the fourth part, Of the Kingdom of Darkness, he explains various ways in which priestly religion has corrupted religion and transgressed the rights of the sovereign. </p></p><p>Hobbes&#39; Leviathan is arguably the greatest piece of political philosophy written in the English language.

Our willingness to move, take risks, and adapt to change have produced a dynamic economy and a tradition of innovation from Ben Franklin to Steve Jobs.</p><p>The problem, according to legendary blogger, economist and best selling author Tyler Cowen, is that Americans today have broken from this tradition&#x2015;we&#x2019;re working harder than ever to <i>avoid</i> change. We're moving residences less, marrying people more like ourselves and choosing our music and our mates based on algorithms that wall us off from anything that might be too new or too different. Match.com matches us in love. Spotify and Pandora match us in music. Facebook matches us to just about everything else.</p><p>Of course, this &#x201c;matching culture&#x201d; brings tremendous positives: music we like, partners who make us happy, neighbors who want the same things.

We are postponing change, due to our near-sightedness and extreme desire for comfort, but ultimately this will make change, when it comes, harder. The forces unleashed by the Great Stagnation will eventually lead to a major fiscal and budgetary crisis: impossibly expensive rentals for our most attractive cities, worsening of residential segregation, and a decline in our work ethic.

In this untold WW II story McFarland, who teaches history at Auburn University, and Newton ( The Perilous Sky ) suggest that the turning point occurred with Gen. James Doolitte's command decision that U.S. fighters, instead of protecting American bombers directly, would henceforth seek out and destroy German fighters. With the German training establishment unable to replace losses in its fighter arm, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower could tell his D-Day invasion troops, ``If you see fighting aircraft over you, they will be ours.''

His music is rooted in the tradition of Elgar, Sir Charles Parry, Vaughan Williams, and early twentieth-century composers who, like Ivor Gurney, revered songwriting as their principal means of expression. </p><p>In this witty and engaging biography, Stephen Banfield reveals the modest, quintessentially English composer as a more complex figure than he is often given credit for being. Finzi's ambiguous relationship with his craft, his affluent and intellectual family, and his struggles with his Jewishness lent a mysterious and troubled quality to his life and work that, through the course of this challenging biography, invite us to question the notions of Englishness that he both so cherished and represented.</p></p><p>Stephen Banfield is Elgar Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He is the author of Sensibility and English Song and Sondheim&#39;s Broadway Musicals, and editor of the twentieth-century volume of The Blackwell History of Music in Britain.In Britain, the works of Finzi (1901-56) are generally admired and oft-recorded, but his Anglophilic musical landscapes have not resonated as strongly with American audiences. Despite his native popularity, it has taken over 40 years for a full-length biography of the composer to be published. (John C. Dressler's Gerald Finzi, part of Greenwood's "Biobibliographies in Music" series, serves to introduce the composer's work. ) The Finzi Trust commissioned this work, but it retains a welcome tone of objectivity. Banfield (music, Univ. of Birmingham, UK) uses a staggering number of letters to and from Finzi, which shed light on a personality and artistic temperament more complex than often thought. Finzi's compositions reflect a strain of English Romanticism born of his love for the Hampshire countryside, yet his lifelong attempt to reconcile his "Englishness" with his Italian Jewish heritage led to an undercurrent of mystery and pathos in much of his work. Banfield's text proceeds chronologically, with numerous musical examples embedded throughout. Readers should come away with a greater appreciation of Finzi's large and varied output but may find the wealth of detail tedious.

Yet her notebooks reveal that she embarked upon many more compositions, some existing in only fragmentary form and some embodied in extensive drafts. <i>Edgar Allen Poe &amp; The Juke-Box</i> presents, alongside facsimiles of many notebook pages from which they are drawn, poems Bishop began soon after college, reflecting her passion for Elizabethan verse and surrealist technique; love poems and dream fragments from the 1940s; poems about her Canadian childhood; and many other works that heretofore have been quoted almost exclusively in biographical and critical studies.</p><p>This revelatory and moving selection brings us into the poet's laboratory, showing us the initial provocative images that moved her to begin a poem, illustrating terrain unexplored in the work published during her lifetime.

Published in March 2006 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC. All rights reserved. <br> <br> <i>Introduction</i> <br> <br>To visit the Department of Special Collections, Vassar College Libraries, and explore the abundance of Elizabeth Bishop material is to enter a universe of fascinating proportions. In the boxes that preserve more than thirty-five hundred pages of Bishop's writing are brief, indelible character sketches. ("Loved the wrong person all his life / lived in the wrong place / maybe even read the wrong books--"), bits of overheard dialogue she found irresistible, notes for stories, commentary on poetry she revered (by Herbert, Hopkins, Stevens, and Moore, particularly), wholly arresting, distinctly characteristic bits of description ("the bureau trapped in the moon-light, like a creature saying 'oh' "; "Begonias ghostly in a galvanized bucket"), accounts of dreams, drawings, menus, shopping lists, and hosts of fascinating remarks on the art of poetry, as well as the occasional withering comment on a poem, an essay, or a literary attitude or viewpoint she deplored. Of Robert Bridges, Poet Laureate of England and friend to Hopkins, for instance, she writes, "The reasonableness of all his ideas is too much--not a touch of the fanatical. He seems to have made himself into a poet out of wisdom--after deciding, sensibly, it was the best profession life had to offer him." There are also--especially in her notebooks from the 1930s and '40s, when she was often desperately uncertain about the direction of her work and her life--anguished <i>cris de coeur</i>, indicating how much courage and bedrock stamina her survival entailed. <br> <br>Many of the titles set down in the notebooks are referred to just once, including early groups with marvelous descriptive tags indicating Bishop's ideas for them. Her post-college journal, which she began on the island of Cuttyhunk off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in July 1934, lists the following on one page: " 'The Citrus Fruit'--love &amp; friendship, 'The Emblem in the Eye'--6 sonnets, 'Flags and Banners'--motion in dreams, and 'An Individual Island for Everyone' (breakfast foods, etc.--satire)." <br> <br>And there are innumerable fragments and drafts of poems, work that she did not complete to her satisfaction or considered trifling; drafts with phrases that haunted her, showing up again and again in her notebooks over the course of years; drafts with lines written out in a rush but accompanied by a chosen rhyme scheme; fragments that showcase verbal gestures familiar to Bishop readers from the more successful resolution of those gestures in the poems we know--all of it work that for one reason or another she chose not to publish but did not destroy. <br> <br>Thinking about poetry in the highest terms was instinctive for Bishop and meeting her own standards was almost impossible, and this may account for the extraordinary quality of her unpublished work. In a letter to Marianne Moore dated December 5, 1936, the twenty-five-year-old Bishop discusses her reaction to the new book by Wallace Stevens, <i>Owl's Clover</i>, making clear how deeply she is pondering what poetry can and ought to do: "What strikes me as so wonderful about the whole book--because I dislike the way he occasionally seems to make blank verse <i>moo</i>--is that it is such a display of ideas at work--making poetry, the poetry making them, etc. That, it seems to me, is the way a poet should think." In another early letter to Moore, she asks, "Can you please forgive me and believe that it is really because I want to do something well that I don't do it at all?" <br> <br>Early on, editors understood her perfectionism and regularly tried to goad her to let go and send them her poems. She began publishing in <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1940 at the age of twenty-nine, and on March 9, 1955, Katharine White wrote to her, "As usual, this letter is a plea to let us see some of the Elizabeth Bishop manuscripts that I feel certain are on your desk, all finished if only you could bring yourself to part with them." Many years later, on May 26, 1972, Howard Moss, who had succeeded White as Bishop's editor and who became her friend, wrote exuberantly to her about a poem he had seen in draft years before: " '12 O'Clock News' is marvelous and we're delighted to have it&#x2026;I was particularly happy to see that 'unicyclist' back. I've been waiting for him for years&#x2026;Like Beethoven's father, I'd simply put you in a room and make you work all the time if I could. Of course, I wouldn't be that strict. A little gin, a few sandwiches&#x2026;" <br> <br>In a talk about poetry prepared but not presented in Rio in the 1960s (and included in full in the appendix), Bishop writes of the challenges as she conceived of them: "Off and on I have written out a poem called 'Grandmother's Glass Eye' which should be about the problem of writing poetry. The situation of my grandmother strikes me as rather like the situation of the poet: the difficulty of combining the real with the decidedly un-real; the natural with the unnatural; the curious effect a poem produces of being as normal as <i>sight</i> and yet as synthetic, as artificial, as a <i>glass eye</i>." <br> <br>* * * <br> <br>None of the material here was stamped by Elizabeth Bishop for publication with the notable exception of her villanelle "One Art," which is included here in the appendix along with the sixteen available drafts of the poem as numbered by the Vassar archive. There is disagreement among scholars about the sequence of the drafts--see <i>Elizabeth Bishop: Life and the Memory of It</i> by Brett C. Millier and <i>Elizabeth Bishop's Poetics of Intimacy</i> by Victoria Harrison (both noted in the bibliography)--but the set as it is offers a unique opportunity to study a Bishop poem from inception to fulfillment. The poem was written within months as distinct from the sometimes decades-long separation between a poem's beginning and Bishop's satisfaction with it. Bishop kept the drafts together. And it seems the appropriate candidate for inclusion--for the sake of contrast and study--in this book of unfinished work. <br> <br>The illustrated poem that opens the book, " 'I introduce Penelope Gwin&#x2026;,' " a portrait of the artist as a young girl, must have pleased Bishop when she wrote it, but where could it have found a home in her oeuvre while she was alive except in an essay on her juvenilia? <br> <br>In a letter dated January 20, 1938, when she was about to turn twenty-seven, Bishop sent "Money," one of the slighter poems collected here, to Marianne Moore. She referred to the poem as "a sort of joke (made out of a sentence in Dostoevsky's <i>House of the Dead</i>: 'Money comes and goes like a bird.')" Graduating from college during the Depression, though, Bishop had cause to ponder the subject seriously, and her conclusion--that money's "migratory habits" are "stern, both ignorant and wise"--is captivating even if the poem is too tidy and circumscribed to have passed muster with her. The little poem also shows the kind of phrase that could hook Bishop and motivate her to begin a poem. <br> <br>Bishop's notebooks from the 1940s are full of touching evocation of Mrs. Hannah Almyda, her housekeeper in Key West, whom she described lovingly in letters to friends. But it's at the moment when Bishop seizes upon a powerful metaphor--"the Pelican, self-sacrificing, tearing feathers from its breast to line its nest"--and writes "for a poem?" in the margin that the depth of her regard for her friend and the scale of her own dependence become manifest. <br> <br>On a draft of "Hannah A." Bishop writes "stiff," and yet what she sets down allows us to experience how rhyme--which she describes in an early notebook entry as "mystical"--helped her marshal and explore her thinking, and how poetry, as she remarks in a letter to May Swenson, is "a way of thinking with one's feelings." <br>* * * <br> <br>This book opens with two poems from girlhood followed by a number of poems written just after college, in the mid-1930s when Bishop settled in New York and set about methodically reading English poetry on her own, working on her knowledge of French at Columbia, and studying the clavichord with Ralph Kirkpatrick. These early poems reflect her interest in allegory and her pressing need to explore the subject of love. These are followed by poems drafted on her travels to Ireland, France, and Spain, and a fragment jotted down on her first trip to Florida in December 1936. <br> <br>The kernel of the book derives from two notebooks dating, roughly, from 1937 to 1947, which Bishop entrusted to a close friend, Linda Nemer, as she left Brazil in 1970-71 after what she later described as "the fifteen happiest years of my life." Nemer showed the notebooks to the poet and scholar Lorrie Goldensohn on a visit Goldensohn made to Ouro Pr�to in the spring of 1986. As Goldensohn recounts the episode in her book <i>Elizabeth Bishop: The Biography of a Poetry</i>, "Bishop emptied the contents of her desk in Rio, and told Linda that she was likely to outlive her: she must keep these papers. Sell them if she liked, but if so, get a good price for them." Goldensohn initiated arrangements for the purchase of these materials by Lisa Browar, who was then curator of the Department of Special Collections, Vassar College Libraries. Most of the poems in the third section of this book come from these two notebooks, referred to in the notes section as the Key West notebooks and identified by their folder numbers, 75.3a and b and 75.4a and b, in the Vassar archive. The title poem, "Edgar Allan Poe &amp; The Juke-Box," is the last developed draft in the first of the notebooks. Many years after she left Key West, Bishop showed the poem to Robert Giroux, her editor from 1956 until her death, saying that she had envisioned it as the concluding one in her second collection. Her letters and journals of the period (abundantly quoted in the notes) testify to the role Poe had in her thinking in the late 1930s, and the poem is also biographically significant, pointing up the considerable anguish she was experiencing before her move to Brazil in 1951. <br> <br>Dating drafts is challenging and sometimes impossible. Bishop famously began poems and set them aside for years. "The Moose," we know, had its origins in a bus trip the poet took in 1946, and she continued to work on the poem after reading it in June 1972 at the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony at Harvard. Every trip to Vassar yields new insights about the material presented here. Bishop's prose account of a newsreel she watched in September 1954--see "Suicide of a (Moderate) Dictator," in the appendix--also contains reference to a poem, "Dicky and Sister," which she continued to work on in a notebook from the 1970s, the draft of which appears here, on page 170. <br> <br>The two Key West notebooks of the thirties and forties are numbered. It's clear that Bishop did not fill one notebook before beginning the other--both have entries from the late forties--and yet because of references to historical events, to a change of residence, or to travels that have been documented elsewhere, in letters or other writing, it appears that she used the one identified as 75.4a and b mostly in the earlier period, from the mid-thirties through the early forties, and the second, identified as 75.3a and b, from the mid-forties up through 1947. The notebook page numbers provide a rare if far from foolproof framework, and the drafts in Section III are sequenced accordingly, with a clutch of poems written around 1942 placed between the drafts in the first and second notebooks. In the notes section, I quote the source material that dates these poems positioned between the first and second notebooks to 1942 or thereabouts, but there was considerable guesswork involved. <br> <br>A number of drafts from the Key West notebooks are accompanied by the notation "Bone Key" or "Key of Bone," which Bishop evidently contemplated as a title for either a sequence or a collection of poems about Key West. A notebook page with lines from the draft "After the Rain" indicates some of her thinking: <br> <br>" <i>one of the children thinks</i>-- <br> <br>Bone Key <br> <br>Key West, Largo Hueso, <i>Key of Bone</i>. <br>&amp; sees a key like one to the front door <br>made of white bone. The island is <br>the white coral bone key to <br>the sea, <br>the depths of the gulf-- <br> <br>More evocative description of Key West follows, some of it again from "After the Rain": <br> <br>(The kites are flown; <br>the puddles are gone.) <br> <br>The palm trees will make their entrance <br>into the evening sky. The water-tower <br>is silvered with metallic paint, <br>moon on stilts. <br>The moon-flower wilts. <br> <br>The drafts earmarked for "Bone Key" include " 'From the shallow night-long graves&#x2026;,' " "The Street by the Cemetery," "Florida Deserta," "Edgar Allan Poe &amp; The Juke-Box," and "After the Rain," which she continued working on after she moved to Brazil, writing to her editor at Houghton Mifflin in September 1953 that she intended to include it in her second collection. <br> <br>To order drafts in subsequent sections, I've depended on the dates Bishop gave them or that Vassar affixed to them, on the testimony of Bishop's friends, on references provided in her letters and journals, on the conjectures of established scholars to whom I'm greatly indebted, and on my own sense of chronology derived from an immersion in Bishop's papers for many years. But it must be explicitly stated that the ordering of this material is in no manner definitive. <br> <br>In transcribing the poems, I sought to present the most coherent, intact drafts, and I've indicated in the notes whether a draft is singular or one of several extant. Facsimile representation seemed the best way to reflect the state of some of the drafts (and the challenge of transcription) as well as the most exciting way to present them. (The note on the text which follows provides a more detailed description of sequencing, transcription, and other editorial decisions.) <br> <br>Much, if not all, of the material assembled here has been quoted in the many excellent books on Bishop's poetry published in the years since her papers were graciously made available for study by her literary executor, Alice Methfessel. It's my hope that this book will provide an adventure for readers who love the established canon, enabling them to hear echoes and make connections based on their own intuitions and close reading of both the finished and the unfinished poems. <br> <br></p><h2>Christmas Remembered</h2><p><p>Ben Logan won the hearts of readers the world over with his 1975 memoir,�&nbsp;<i>The Land Remembers</i>.

Written with the general reader in mind, <em>Reading Dante</em> brings her knowledge to bear in an accessible yet expert introduction to his great poem. <p>This is far more than an exegesis of Dante&#x2019;s three-part <em>Commedia</em>. Shaw communicates the imaginative power, the linguistic skill and the emotional intensity of Dante&#x2019;s poetry&#x2015;the qualities that make the <em>Commedia</em> perhaps the greatest literary work of all time and not simply a medieval treatise on morality and religion.</p><p>The book provides a graphic account of the complicated geography of Dante's version of the afterlife and a sure guide to thirteenth-century Florence and the people and places that influenced him. At the same time it offers a literary experience that lifts the reader into the universal realms of poetry and mythology, creating links not only to the classical world of Virgil and Ovid but also to modern art and poetry, the world of T. S. Eliot, Seamus Heaney and many others.</p><p>Dante's questions are our questions: What is it to be a human being? How should we judge human behavior? What matters in life and in death? <em>Reading Dante</em> helps the reader to understand Dante&#x2019;s answers to these timeless questions and to see how surprisingly close they sometimes are to modern answers.</p><p><em>Reading Dante</em> is an astonishingly lyrical work that will appeal to both those who&#x2019;ve never read the <em>Commedia</em> and those who have. It underscores Dante's belief that poetry can change human lives.</p> 34 illustrations</p><p>Prue Shaw is emeritus reader in Italian studies at University College London and the editor of the edizione nazionale of Dante&#x2019;s Monarchia and of a digital edition of the Commedia. She lives in Cambridge, England.&#x201c;Dante expert Shaw explains so easily and simply, she eliminates all trepidation in anyone daunted by his masterpiece... Shaw exposes the profound depth and art of poetry that encompasses so much more than language and rhythm.... Read this book to discover Dante the man, the pilgrim and the poet.

This beautifully clarifying keystone anthology, therefore, couldn&#x2019;t be more timely in its illumination of the full Latino spectrum in exceptional literature rooted in Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, and Dominican American cultures, as well in other Spanish-speaking countries. Prolific and versatile Stavans and his fellow editors have gathered a glorious chorus of 201 voices spanning five centuries and diverse traditions. Stavans lays the groundwork: &#x201c;First, at its core, Latino literature is about the tension between double attachments to place, to language, and to identity.&#x201d; Stavans and company subsequently track the interaction between Hispanic and Anglo perspectives as they succinctly yet vividly cover the historical and political events that have shaped and fueled Latino writing both reportorial and imaginative. With a great array of writers celebrated and too little known, and invaluable supporting materials, this grand and affecting treasury of culturally rich and aesthetically dynamic poems, fiction, drama, letters, diaries, and essays illuminates every aspect of Latino life. While the great poet Jos� Mart� writes of &#x201c;weapons of the mind, which vanquish all others,&#x201d; journalist Rub�n Mart�nez begins his chronicle of the Mexican-U.S. border with a sentence laced with profound implications: &#x201c;I am close to the line.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Levittown: Two Families, One Tycoon, and the Fight for Civil Rights in America&#39;s Legendary Suburb</h2><p><p><b>The dark side of the American dream: the true story of the first African-American family to move into the iconic suburb, Levittown, PA . </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>In the decade after World War II , one entrepreneurial family helped thousands of people buy into the American dream of owning a home. T he Levitts&#x2015;William, Alfred, and their father, Abe&#x2015;pooled their talents to create storybook towns with affordable little houses. T hey laid out the welcome mat, but not to everyone. Levittown had a whites-only policy. </p><p>The events that unfolded in Levittown, PA, in the unseasonably hot summer of 1957 would rock the community. There, a white Jewish Communist family named Wechsler secretly arranged for a black family, the Myerses, to buy the pink house next door. T he explosive reaction would transform their lives, and the nation, leading to the downfall of a titan and the integration of the most famous suburb in the world. <i>Levittown </i>is a story of hope and fear, invention and rebellion, and the power that comes when ordinary people take an extraordinary stand. And it is as relevant today, more than fifty years later, as it was then.</p></p><p>&#34;A propulsive, deft page-turner...Kushner achieves cinematic immediacy in reconstructing the events, focusing on the entwined experiences of Levitt and the two families, and the backdrop of Levittown in a moment when suburbanites chose between everyday evil and their better angels.&#34; --TIME OUT CHICAGO"A gripping, beautifully-written history of a hot summer in one town where so many threads of postwar American history came together-suburbanization, segregation, the civil rights movement, McCarthyism. A real page-turner."--Stephanie Coontz, author, The Way We Never Were and Marriage, a History. <p>"Kushner has gathered a mass of material, organized it effectively, and tells a gripping story. After reading it, Americans will understand how suburbs became so white in the first place and what two families --one black, one white -- did to remedy the situation.""-- James Loewen, author of Lies My Teacher Told Me and Sundown Towns. </p> <p>"In 1957, Bev and Lew Wechsler, activists and residents of Levittown, PA, welcomed Daisy and Bill Myers and their children to move next door. The Myers thus became the first black family to reside in Levittown, built and maintained as an explicitly "whites only" suburb. Rolling Stone contributing editor Kushner (Masters of Doom) frames the Myers's story within the rise of self-assured entrepreneur developer Bill Levitt, who built wildly successful postwar suburbs and was an unrepentant defender of racially exclusive policies. Kushner also limns the contemporary civil rights struggle but focuses on the immediate fallout of the Myers's move into Levittown: nonstop protests, near-riots, and threats from appalled residents backed by out-of-town white supremacists, which were countered by the Wechslers and other forward-thinking residents with support from local Quaker and human rights groups. Though the Myers family prevailed in the courts, and Levitt's communities would be officially integrated by 1960, the tension of that summer is still palpable in this gripping account. Timing gives this publication an additional layer of historic intrigue: in November 2008, voters in Bucks County, PA, home to Levittown, selected Barack Obama for President by an 8.5 percent margin. Recommended for all public libraries and essential for regional collections."--Library Journal. </p> <p>"In an entertaining round-robin format, Kushner relays each party's story in the leadup to a combustible summer when the integration of America's most famous suburb cause the downfall of a titan and transformed the nation." --Publishers Weekly.</p></p><h2>A Density of Souls</h2><p>A Density of Souls is the story of four high school friends in present-day New Orleans who are torn apart by envy, passion and a secret murder. Meredith, Brandon, Greg and Stephen quickly discover the fragile boundaries between friendship and betrayal as they enter high school and form new allegiances. Brandon and Greg gain popularity as football jocks and Meredith joins the bulimic in-crowd, while Stephen is treated as a outcast and is the target of homophobia in a school that viciously mocks him. Then two violent deaths disrupt the core of what they once shared. Five years later the friends are drawn back together as new facts about their mutual history are revealed and what was held to be a tragic accident is discovered to be murder. A the true story emerges, other secrets begin to unravel and the casual cruelties of high school develop into acts of violence that threaten on entire city. Unputdownable, A Destiny of Souls is a stunning debut novel that lays the darker side of the teenage psyche in modern-day life.</p><p>Take the sensuous, fecund New Orleans setting, add a generous helping of tangled Southern family history, and season liberally with a sensitive teenage boy rejected by his friends and frightened of his own homoerotic impulses and you wouldn't be surprised to discover that the novel containing all of the above was written by someone named Rice. But a few paragraphs into the first page, it's clear that Anne Rice's son's first novel isn't about vampires or witches and does not otherwise read like one of her exceedingly popular books. The only family resemblance is in the setting, the sexual orientation of the lovingly described male characters, and the scent of overripe magnolias. <p> There's murder, suicide, and madness at the heart of this rather clumsy coming-of-age story, which focuses on the youthful friendship of Stephen Conlin, Meredith Ducote, Greg Darby, and Brandon Charbonnet. This friendship is destroyed by a sexual incident that takes place just before the foursome enters Cannon, an exclusive prep school. There, Stephen is ostracized by his former friends, now the most popular kids on campus, who'd just as soon forget their own complicity in the event. Envy, passion, and rage drive the narrative, but the emotions are as juvenile as the characters, and the long passages depicting the rituals and cruelties of high school, from pep rallies to football games, slow down the pace without really illuminating character or motivation. The novel reads like a roman � clef. Rice might have been wiser to tell someone else's story rather than his own. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><strong>Christopher Rice</strong> was born in Berkeley, California and moved to New Orleans with his parents at the age of ten.

Miyamoto Usagi braved many a battle only to lose his lord and find himself a masterless samurai, or ronin. While many ronin became bandits or mercenaries, Usagi chose the warrior pilgrimage: wandering the land, fighting injustice, seeking enlightenment. Eisner Award winner Stan Sakai has crafted a truly original and delightful work, an all-ages adventure epic that creates a world of excitement, mystery, and imagination, while building each story on painstaking research of Japan&#39;s history, culture, and mythology. Demon Mask is a collection of diverse Usagi stories, featuring a graveyard encounter with creatures from Japanese folktales, a whodunit clash with a mysterious masked assassin, a young adventure-lover insistent on receiving Usagi&#39;s sword training, a peasant village terrorized by a ravaging Spider Woman, and more. Few works of graphic fiction offer -- or deliver -- as much action, depth, and sheer fun as Stan Sakai&#39;s Usagi Yojimbo.</p><p>Usagi Yojimbo is an enduring work. Bravo. -- <i>Will Eisner</i></p><h2>The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume 1 (Foundations of Natural History)</h2><p><p>The publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859 ignited a public storm he neither wanted nor enjoyed. Having offered his book as a contribution to science, Darwin discovered to his dismay that it was received as an affront by many scientists and as a sacrilege by clergy and Christian citizens. To answer the criticism that his theory was a theory only, and a wild one at that, he published two volumes in 1868 to demonstrate that evolution was obvious to anyone who cared to look at a bull in a pasture or a dog on a hearth.</p><p>In response to those who insisted that species were distinct since creation, Darwin pointed to breeders of pigs and pigeons. In reply to those who protested that human intervention is one thing and natural selection another, he argued, "If organic beings had not possessed an inherent tendency to vary, man could have done nothing." To counter those who scorned his descriptions of species in exotic places, he submitted local evidence of cabbages and cauliflower.</p><p>Based on a wide array of sources, from ancient pictographs to Polish roosters, from skins and from skeletons, from scientific journals and breeding manuals, Darwin assembled a mass of proof--and a hypothesis about species reversion that risked his reputation anew. The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication is a two-volume compilation of his thorough and intensive research and the revolutionary conclusions that resulted. The first portion of his work is dedicated to a meticulous analysis of various aspects of plant and animal life, including an inventory of varieties and their physical and behavioral characteristics, investigation of the impact of a species' surrounding environment and the role that both natural and forced changes in this environment have had. Darwin then turns to a richly detailed discussion of the roles of inheritance and crossing in the development of species. A wealth of illustrations further support and enhance his findings. This fascinating, invaluable, and courageous undertaking eventually formed the foundation for our current understanding of evolution.</p><p>"In science as in politics the victors tend to write the history books. As a result, the record of the past is edited, intentionally or unintentionally, so that it focuses mainly on the precursors of contemporary orthodoxy. Such a focus may accurately represent the genealogy of modern ideas, but it almost inevitably misrepresents the historical experience of their progenitors... Even the powerful, persuasive, and ultimately triumphant theory of evolution by natural selection required not only defense, but repeated buttressing and revision. Variation showed Darwin hard at work on this rearguard action, using the materials he had at hand... His information was gleaned from the observations of fanciers, breeders, and amateur naturalists, as well as from the treatises of those on the cutting edge of zoology and botany. As hindsight narrows the historical spotlight, it imposes its own sense of hierarchy on the preoccupations of the past. But Darwin was interested in all of these topics, valued all of these sources, and belonged, to a greater or lesser extent, to all of these communities."--from the Introduction.</p></p><p>The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication follows from the first chapters of On the Origin of Species. Volume 1 deals with variations introduced into species as a result of domestication. It is a masterpiece of nineteenth-century scientific investigation and a key text in the development of Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theories.<p>Harriet Ritvo is the Arthur J.

But still, I am one. I cannot do everything,<br> but still I can do something. And because I cannot do everything,<br> I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.<br> </i>Edward Everett Hale<p> My husband, Hanoch, and I wrote a book <i>Acts of Kindness: How to Create a Kindness Revolution</i>, which has generated much interest across America. This story was shared with us by an anonymous caller during a radio talk show in Chicago.</p><p> "Hi, Mommy, what are you doing?" asked Susie.</p><p> "I'm making a casserole for Mrs. Smith next door," said her mother.</p><p> "Why?" asked Susie, who was only six years old. </p><p> "Because Mrs. Smith is very sad; she lost her daughter and she has a broken heart. We need to take care of her for a little while." </p><p> "Why, Mommy?" </p><p> "You see, Susie, when someone is very, very sad, they have trouble doing the little things like making dinner or other chores. Because we're part of a community and Mrs. Smith is our neighbor, we need to do some things to help her. Mrs. Smith won't ever be able to talk with her daughter or hug her or do all those wonderful things that mommies and daughters do together. You are a very smart girl, Susie; maybe you'll think of some way to help take care of Mrs. Smith." </p><p> Susie thought seriously about this challenge and how she could do her part in caring for Mrs. Smith. A few minutes later, Susie knocked on her door. After a few moments Mrs. Smith answered the knock with a "Hi, Susie." </p><p> Susie noticed that Mrs. Smith didn't have that familiar musical quality about her voice when she greeted someone. </p><p> Mrs. Smith also looked as though she might have been crying because her eyes were watery and swollen."What can I do for you, Susie?" asked Mrs. Smith. </p><p> "My mommy says that you lost your daughter and you're very, very sad with a broken heart." Susie held her hand out shyly. In it was a Band-Aid. "This is for your broken heart." Mrs. Smith gasped, choking back her tears. She knelt down and hugged Susie. Through her tears she said, "Thank you, darling girl, this will help a lot." </p><p> Mrs. Smith accepted Susie's act of kindness and took it one step further. She purchased a small key ring with a plexiglass picture frame -- the ones designed to carry keys and proudly display a family portrait at the same time. Mrs. Smith placed Susie's Band-Aid in the frame to remind herself to heal a little every time she sees it. She wisely knows that healing takes time and support. It has become her symbol for healing, while not forgetting the joy and love she experienced with her daughter. </p><p> </p><p></p>Meladee McCarty <b><p> � 1994 Meladee McCarty</p> </b><p>All rights reserved.

Now <i>The Forgotten Ways Handbook</i> moves beyond theory to practice, offering ways for any missionally minded person to apply the ideas contained in <i>The Forgotten Ways </i>to their life and ministry.<br><br>This intensely practical handbook includes many helpful tools: summary sections encapsulating the ideas contained in each chapter in a popular way; suggested practices to help readers embed missional paradigms concretely; and adult learning-based techniques and examples from other churches and organizations that enable readers to process and assimilate the ideas in a group context. <br><br>EXCERPT<br>Make no mistake about it; the scope of the change that is required to shift to the kind of movement described in <i>The Forgotten Ways </i>is nothing less than paradigmatic. Every element of mDNA poses a direct challenge to the prevailing ways of doing church and mission. When taken together, all six elements of Apostolic Genius make the task seem enormous. But we don't think it is actually as difficult as it seems. And it is certainly not impossible. The Chinese church proves that a highly institutionalized form of Christianity can become a remarkable movement given the right circumstances. And we don't believe that we have to have persecution to activate Apostolic Genius. Less intense forms of adaptive challenges can, and do, force the church to respond. What we are witnessing in our own day indicates that. Because the church carries the gospel as well as the full coding of Apostolic Genius in her, the potential for world transformation is always present in us. We can always draw upon latent resources and instincts. God is able and very willing to stir his church up. In fact we see this as one of the very special works of the Holy Spirit--to awaken God's people to their calling and destiny as a movement that can and will change the world.</p><p><b>Put into Practice the Best-Selling Missional Guide </b><b><i>The Forgotten Ways<br><br></i></b>"The business of engaging in mission to the West begins with a new imagination or, as Alan says, 'a new way of thinking.'

Authorized by the makers of Scrabble Brand crossword games and endorsed by the National Scrabble Association for recreational and school use.</p><p>If you&#39;re using the 1991 edition or the 1978 original, you&#39;re woefully behind the Scrabble-playing times. With more than 100,000 2- to 8-letter words, there are some interesting additions (&#34;aargh,&#34; &#34;aarrgh,&#34; and &#34;aarrghh&#34; are all legitimate now), while words they consider offensive are no longer kosher. Why subscribe to the Scrabble dictionary&#39;s changeable lexicon? Well, it ends the argument of whose dictionary to use, but the main reason is that it&#39;s the winner&#39;s dictionary, and why play Scrabble if not to win? Memorize those 2- and 3-letter words, and your Scrabble game becomes lethal.<p> The Merriam brothers desired a continuity of editorship that would link Noah Webster's efforts with their own editions, so they selected Chauncey A. Goodrich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, who had been trained in lexicography by Webster himself, to be their editor in chief. Webster's son William also served as an editor of that first Merriam-Webster dictionary, which was published on September 24, 1847. </p> <p> Although Webster's work was honored, his big dictionaries had never sold well. The 1828 edition was priced at a whopping $20; in 13 years its 2,500 copies had not sold out. Similarly, the 1841 edition, only slightly more affordable at $15, moved slowly. Assuming that a lower price would increase sales, the Merriams introduced the 1847 edition at $6, and although Webster's heirs initially questioned this move, extraordinary sales that brought them $250,000 in royalties over the ensuing 25 years convinced them that the Merriams' decision had been abundantly sound. </p> <p> The first Merriam-Webster dictionary was greeted with wide acclaim. President James K. Polk, General Zachary Taylor (hero of the Mexican War and later president himself), 31 U.S. senators, and other prominent people hailed it unreservedly. In 1850 its acceptance as a resource for students began when Massachusetts ordered a copy for every school and New York placed a similar order for 10,000 copies to be used in schools throughout the state. Eventually school use would spread throughout the country. In becoming America's most trusted authority on the English language, Merriam-Webster dictionaries had taken on a role of public responsibility demanded of few other publishing companies.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Growing Up in Heaven: The Eternal Connection Between Parent and Child</h2><p><p>&#x201c;[JamesVan Praagh] has changed people&#x2019;s lives, banished thefear of death, and brought grieving parents the solace of their dead children&#x2019;spresence . . .

The design of the book is unique, addressing the various muscles and functions of the body with detailed explanations of the appropriate exercises and their modifications and progressions. Noble has taught prenatal and postpartum exercise to women, and health care providers for 40 years. She is the &#34;grande dame&#34; of body awareness, remedial positions and movements during the childbearing year.I wrote the first edition of this book in the early 70s when I moved to the US from Australia where I trained as a physical therapist and gained experience in maternity hospitals and my own practice of classes and treatments for childbearing women. In those days, women were limited pretty much to childbirth classes late in their pregnancies, which did not help prevent the discomforts of pregnancy. Then along came high impact aerobics! That led to a lot of stress urinary incontinence, and did not address positioning, comfort measures, the role of the key muscles during each phase of the childbearing year. My goal is a safe and sane program that is valuable for the rest of a woman&#39;s life as well as her childbearing years, by explaining the structure and function of the body so a woman understands the rationale for each position and exercise.</p><h2>The Mask</h2><p>A beautiful young girl appears out of nowhere.

Much easier than writing books.&#x201d; And write letters Ed Abbey did. In his famous or infamous 45-year career, Abbey&#x2019;s cards and letters became as legendary as his books for their wit, vitriol, and ability to speak truth to power. Published here for the first time, the letters offer a fascinating, often hilarious glimpse into the mind of one of America&#x2019;s most iconoclastic and beloved authors. No subject was too banal, too arcane, or too deep for Abbey to expound on: sex, cheerleaders, Mormons, Aspen, and the Bond girls are covered as gleefully as Stegner, Dylan, Chomsky, Buddhism, and betrayal. Whether scolding an editor to simplify ( I&#x2019;ve had to waste hours erasing that storm of fly-shit on the typescript&#x201d;) or skewering the chicken-hawk proponents of the war in Vietnam, Abbey&#x2019;s righteous indignation gives hope and inspiration to a generation that desperately needs both.</p><p>Edward Abbey (1927-89) was contrary, incorrect, ribald, brilliant, prescient, outspoken, and outraged. He wrote ravishing and stinging essays about the glorious and endangered Southwest (<i>Desert Solitaire</i> is now a classic) and wildly satiric novels--most famously <i>The Monkey Wrench </i>Gang--that explode our cherished myths of the frontier and so-called progress. Abbey wrote incessantly when he wasn't hiking, wooing women, playing with his kids, brooding, or torching billboards, and his favorite thing to write was letters to family, friends, fellow writers, and, most entertainingly, editors of various newspapers and magazines. Abbey expert David Petersen has constructed a high-voltage letter collection that covers every facet of Cactus Ed's full-throttle life, prickly personality, and profound insights into the dire consequences of greed, mindless growth, and the "worship of technology." Every thorny issue Abbey raises in his passionate, entertaining, and hilarious missives remains urgent, from his concerns about rivers and national parks to his harsh anti-immigration diatribes and disgust with commercial culture. Whether he's mocking the New York literati or protesting the Vietnam War, Abbey writes with wit, genius, fury, and molten lyricism. Graced with a profoundly moving foreword by Terry Tempest Williams, this volume of volcanic correspondence is an essential addition to American literature and the literature of the environment. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Touching on civil rights, the environment, Vietnam, immigration, technology, pop culture, industrialism and nearly anything else that has been a hot-button issue since the mid-20th Century, Abbey's letters, collected here and presented in chronological order, offer not only an intriguing portrait of Abbey the writer and individualist, but of the political state of the nation. By turns lucid and measured, warm and intimate, or bitingly cruel (and wickedly funny), Abbey displays a staggering range of concerns, and Abbey's fans will find these missives no less stinging and eloquent than his best fiction. Knowledge of Abbey's work (The Monkey Wrench Gang; Desert Solitaire, etc.) helps put the letters and their author in perspective, though readers unacquainted with Abbey's career may find this a useful introduction.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As fate has it, his parents search for him and his wife takes them into Julian&#39;s castle and lets them sleep in the master bedroom. Julian returns late at night, enters the bedroom, and thinking he has found his wife with a secret lover, murders them both. Realizing that the prophecy has come true, Julian leaves home for a lifetime of wandering and seeking penance. Ultimately he becomes a ferryman at a dangerous river crossing.

Talk about an eye-poppin' show."<br><br>Morgan West stopped in her tracks to lift an eyebrow at a suddenly flustered workman. "Voices carry in museums," she said gently. "You might want to keep that in mind."<br><br>"Yeah. I mean--yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am. No offense meant."<br><br>"None taken. It's always been my ambition to be a museum display."<br><br>He cleared his throat. "Priceless things. That's all I meant. Treasures. Works of art." He eyed her, then sighed. "I'm not gonna win, am I?"<br><br>"No, I'm afraid not."<br><br>"I'm a sexist pig."<br><br>"Pretty much."<br><br>"Objectifying women."<br><br>"This woman anyway. Yes, I'd say that was what you were doing."<br><br>"I apologize, Miss West."<br><br>Perfectly aware that the other workmen near enough to overhear this exchange were hiding grins, Morgan knew when it was time to let her prey off the hook on which he'd impaled himself. "Accepted. Have a nice day."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am. You too."<br><br>Morgan strolled away, knowing that laughter would erupt the moment she was out of sight. Which it did.<br><br>She sighed.<br><br>Her measurements had been causing her problems since her thirteenth birthday, so by now she should have been at least somewhat accustomed to it.<br><br>She wasn't.<br><br>There were men who admitted that long, shapely female legs inspired amorous fantasies; there were those who had the same basic response to the rich curves of swaying hips. But men whose primitive instincts were aroused by an ample bust, Morgan had found, undoubtedly outnumbered the rest.<br><br>Probably something Freudian about it.<br><br>Or something infantile.<br><br>At any rate, her centerfold measurements had caused her more trouble than joy. A lot more. Her dates during high school and college had been so entranced by her charms, she often wondered if they knew what her face looked like. Even the Rhodes scholar she'd briefly gone out with--hoping his mind was on a higher plane--had stuttered dreadfully whenever his gaze strayed to her chest.<br><br>Which was often.<br><br>And that explained one reason why Maxim Bannister had won her intense and total loyalty. He had, to be sure, gulped visibly when she'd first walked into his office, but he had also conducted the hour-long interview without allowing his gaze to stray to her chest--and without making her feel it required all his concentration to avoid staring. And since that time, he had managed not only to make her feel completely comfortable in his presence but had even responded with genuine sympathy when a particularly degrading experience with a date had caused her to unburden herself in an explosion of temper.<br><br>She liked Max a lot. He was one of the very few male friends she'd ever had, and she was delighted by the knowledge that, while he was no less appreciative of nature's bounty than the next man, his awareness and interest were detached rather than hormonal. He also had an unerring eye for color and style, and during the months of preparation for the Mysteries Past exhibit, she had gradually abandoned her dark-colored, loose blouses and multilayered outfits in favor of more elegant and flattering clothing.<br><br>When Max told her she looked good in something, she knew it was the truth. He'd said once that she was a queenly woman, the observation made in an assessing rather than complimentary tone, and Morgan had, quite unconsciously, begun walking without the slump she had just as unconsciously adopted in her teens. In a few short months, he had very quietly and gently and unobtrusively eradicated both Morgan's bitterness and the chip on her shoulder. Thanks to him, she was as proud of her body as she was of her mind.<br><br>Well, nearly.<br><br>Which wasn't to say it no longer caused her problems. In fact, masculine appreciation of her measurements was, indirectly, to blame for a predicament that was destined to occupy her for quite some time.<br><br>But on this mild Thursday afternoon, Morgan was blessedly unaware of the storm clouds building up on her own personal horizon. As the director of the forthcoming Mysteries Past exhibit, her mind was entirely focused on business.<br><br>"You're frowning," Wolfe Nickerson noted when they encountered each other in the lobby. He was the security expert Lloyd's of London had sent to oversee both the preparations for the exhibit and the two-month showing itself.<br><br>"I'm not surprised. Do you believe in intuition?" she asked.<br><br>"I've been known to get a hunch now and then. Why? Are you feeling intuitive?"<br><br>"Yeah. At least--I guess that's what it is. There's something out of focus, Wolfe. Something not right."<br><br>"With the preparations for the exhibit?"<br><br>"I don't know. Maybe." She sighed. "God, I hate it when I get one of these feelings. It's like I saw something out of the corner of my eye, you know? Something I didn't look at as closely as I should have."<br><br>Wolfe nodded. "Yeah, I've been there. But you know as well as I do that it's pretty much impossible to guard against a threat when all you've got to go on is a feeling. We're doing everything we can to protect the collection."<br><br>"Maybe not everything. Would pulling up the drawbridge and flooding the moat be out of order?"<br><br>"Well, it might make things a bit difficult for visitors."<br><br>Morgan hugged her ever-present clipboard and rested her chin on the top, matching his gravity when she said, "Yeah, but do we really need visitors? They come, they gawk--big deal."<br><br>Smiling, Wolfe said, "You really are bothered, aren't you?"<br><br>"A little bit, yeah."<br><br>"But there's nothing here yet to steal, remember? I mean, none of the collection. All those nice display cases the workmen are building are going to be empty for weeks yet."<br><br>"I know, I know."<br><br>"But?"<br><br>"But . . . something's wrong." Morgan shook her head with a faint grimace. "The place just doesn't feel right. I did a walk-through a little while ago, and I could swear I was being watched."<br><br>Wolfe eyed her, a little amused. "Well, you usually are."<br><br>"No, not that way." Morgan was intent on making sense of her own feelings and hunches. "Watched. Almost . . . I was going to say stalked, but I don't mean it in the modern way, with some half-crazed guy who thinks he's in love with me dogging my every step."<br><br>"How do you mean it, then?"<br><br>"More of a . . . predatory thing. As if I was being tracked, shadowed, my strengths and weaknesses sized up."<br><br>Wolfe's eyebrows rose, but more in surprise than disbelief. "That's a fairly primitive image. And a very specific threat to feel intuitively."<br><br>"I know. That's why it's creeping me out, big time."<br><br>He frowned. "All right, Morgan. I'll have the extra guards do a sweep of the building at the beginning of each shift, as well as halfway through the shift. Good enough?"<br><br>"I hope so." She shook her head again, obviously annoyed by worries too elusive to put into words, then added, "I'll be in my office. I'm going to go study the museum blueprints again."<br><br>"Listen," Wolfe said, "don't let the responsibility of being in charge while Max is off on his honeymoon blow anything out of proportion, okay? Whether you're right about somebody watching you or the preparations for the exhibit, the collection is safe and we are doing everything possible to make damned sure it stays that way."<br><br>Morgan squared her shoulders and nodded. "You're right. But I still want to study those blueprints."<br><br>"Have at it. If you see anything that'll help increase or perfect security, I'll be the first to thank you for it."<br><br>"I just want to be sure," Morgan said.<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"It's not that I'm questioning your competence--"<br><br>He waved that away. "I never thought you were. We're both responsible for protecting the collection, Morgan, so don't think you're stepping on my toes by double-checking everything, including your own hunches. I'll do the same."<br><br>"Okay. Just so we're clear."<br><br>"We are." Wolfe watched her head off toward her office, and added under his breath, "We're also both worried. I know why I am . . . but why are you?"<br><br>Carla Reeves was still astonished she'd been able to get a job with a security company. And somewhat amused.<br><br>Security? Yeah, right.<br><br>But unless she wanted to flip burgers or bag groceries, she'd had to take the chance and apply. It was her good luck that Ace Security had been in crying need of a few employees with a security background--and that a guy at her last place of employment had owed her a big, big favor, and had provided a glowing recommendation for her.<br><br>Still, you'd think a fucking security company would have at least checked for a police record before they hired somebody.<br><br>Thanking the universe for small favors and large ones, Carla settled happily into the new job, and within a number of weeks was feeling quite at home there. She was also trusted and given increasing responsibility, which was another amusement but nevertheless appreciated, since it led to a raise.<br><br>Carla liked her job. And she had no plans to fuck things up by doing anything she shouldn't have. She had learned the hard lesson that a one-time big score was seldom worth the risk of getting caught. Besides, she didn't need to do that anymore.<br><br>No, Carla's life was progressing nicely. So nicely, in fact, that she had absolutely no suspicion that everything was about to hit the fan.<br><br>She left work a bit later than usual that evening, mostly because she'd wanted to earn a few employee bonus points by doing some extra work on a security system being designed for a private home--of a personal friend of her boss.<br><br>She walked around the corner to where she'd left her car parked, smiling as she thought of the praise that would be heaped on her in the morning. Bonus points were fun.<br><br>She was fumbling in her purse for her key ring with its remote keyless entry gadget when a pleasant voice stopped her in her tracks.<br><br>"Hello, Carla."<br><br>It wasn't a familiar voice, but Carla had grown up literally on the streets, and she recognized a threat when she heard one. Still too far from her car to make a break for it, she turned very slowly and looked at him.<br><br>He was smiling at her. He was also holding an elegant little gun in one gloved hand.<br><br>"Oh, don't worry, Carla. I don't have rape in mind. Or even robbery."<br><br>She swallowed hard. "Then what do you want?"<br><br>"Just a little information, that's all."<br><br>"Information?"<br><br>"Come now, Carla, let's not pretend. You know what I want. And you know how to get it. After all--you've done it before, haven't you?"<br><br>Carla stared at him, understanding everything he didn't say. "Yeah," she answered dully. "So I do know what you want."<br><br>It was Morgan's habit to be at the museum very early each morning, long before it was open for business, and the next morning was no exception. Also as usual, the first thing she did was to conduct her own sweep of the building.<br><br>It wasn't that she didn't trust the guards, it was just that she trusted her own eyes and other senses more.<br><br>After all the months of preparation for the exhibit, she was very familiar with the cavernous halls and labyrinthine corridors of the museum. So much so, in fact, that she probably could have found her way through with the aid of a flashlight--no mean feat, given the size and complexity of the building.<br><br>Until very recently, she had never felt uneasy being alone in any area of the museum. But as her heels clicked against the polished marble floors, she once again had the oddest feeling that she wasn't as alone as she should have been. She stopped several times, gazing around her with a frown, but no one was there. She was sure no one was there.<br><br>"Morgan, you're losing it," she muttered finally.<br><br>Since this was a museum of historical art, it wasn't nearly as creepy as some she'd worked in. No stuffed or skeletal beasts loomed, and there weren't any exhibits such as Prehistoric Man at the Hunt with figures of man and beast frozen in bloody confrontational poses.<br><br>There was statuary, however, and more than once Morgan caught herself frowning uneasily at a manlike figure in a dim corner that she only belatedly recognized as some artist's work in marble or bronze.<br><br>"Definitely losing it." The sound of her own voice startled her somewhat, and Morgan quickened her steps, even though she kept searching for whatever was bothering her. And found nothing. Or at least found nothing that looked like anything.<br><br>"I don't even know what I'm looking for," she admitted half under her breath.<br><br>But as she turned to retrace her steps, Morgan's uneasiness intensified. The place still didn't feel right to her. She tried to focus on what she was feeling, but it was vague and unformed. Just anxiety and an odd sense of apprehension.<br><br>Morgan stopped at the entrance of the wing and looked back down the echoing corridors. A little laugh escaped her. "We're about to bring a priceless collection of art treasures into this place," she reminded herself aloud. "Of course I'm uneasy about it. That's all. That's all it is."<br><br>With those reassuring words, she turned and headed back for the lobby, her heels once more clicking briskly against the marble floor.<br><br>The sounds were fading away when, in a dim corner Morgan had passed by twice, one of those manlike figures stirred and stepped out of the shadows. He stood gazing after Morgan for several moments, then turned and headed deeper into the museum, his movements utterly silent and almost feline in their fluid grace.<br><br>If anybody had been there to hear, they wouldn't have heard a footstep. But they would have heard a soft, amused chuckle.<br><br>At thirty-six, Wolfe was two years younger than Max Bannister; they were half brothers, raised by their fathers on opposite coasts of the country, and had gotten to know each other well only as adults. But even though their knowledge of each other went back less than fifteen years, there was an unusually strong bond between them. It was one of the reasons Max had specifically requested Wolfe when Lloyd's, which insured the Bannister collection, had insisted on having one of their representatives on the scene during the exhibit and the preparations leading up to it.<br><br>One of the reasons. The other reason was that Wolfe was very, very good at his job. Good enough so that he took the worries of the Mysteries Past director seriously--even if she didn't think so.<br><br>"Morgan, all I said was--"<br><br>"All you said was that I'm nuts." She planted both hands on her hips and glared at Wolfe.</p><h2>A Gift upon the Shore</h2><p>A Gift upon the Shore is a lyrical, haunting story of two women, an artist and a writer, surviving in a dark near future. Driven by rich and fully drawn characters, this is a powerful, compelling story of a friendship that survives the devastation, only to face a more difficult test from the gift found upon the shore It is also about remaining human under the worst of conditions, and the humanizing influence of books and art, even when their existence is threatened.</p><p><p>Gabra Zackman knows romance.&nbsp;Her clever and &#x201c;thrilling romantic caper&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>) Bod Squad series was inspired by the more than one hundred romance and women&#x2019;s fiction titles she has narrated for audio. She divides her time between her native New York City and Denver, Colorado.</p>Would the survivors of nuclear holocaust have any reason to go on living? That is the question that must be answered by two women who have lived through the final conflict and now face the devastating nuclear winter that follows it. Mary and Rachel, the only survivors in their area, believe that choice makes us human, and they choose to affirm their humanity by preserving whatever knowledge can still be saved. Desperately longing for companionship, they hope eventually to meet other survivors. But when contact finally comes, more hard choices come with it. Wren's novel is thought-provoking in its consideration of ordinary people forced to confront the unthinkable. While the plot is not without cliches, and characters are not always fully developed, the author's passionate concern with what gives life meaning carries the novel.

He set himself the goal of becoming famous by age 30, but after achieving fame as a playwright, celebrity suffocated him. Even love affairs became a dull repetition, though he repeated them far and wide, driving one mistress to attempt suicide. He consciously wrote in the romantic style because it made him millions, enabling him to support his various households. The spoiled son of a mulatto general under Napoleon, republican poet Dumas took to the streets in the anti-Bourbon revolution of 1830. He spent a week in jail in 1836 for refusing to serve in the National Guard; the 1848 revolution made him a born-again politician. Com bining elements of tragedy and farce, this captivating biography by a French scholar-diplomat brims with all the brio, gran deur and slapdash energy of The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers , serialized novels Dumas later took to the stage. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eye: How It Works (My Readers)</h2><p><p>Celebrated author-illustrator and master explainer David Macaulay brings his unique voice and style to high-interest nonfiction books for newly independent readers. <br>How can you see that your shirt is on inside out?

But even residents on this idyllic California coast may not realize its full history. Monterey began as a natural paradise, but became the poster child for industrial devastation in John Steinbeck&#x2019;s Cannery Row,and is now one of the most celebrated shorelines in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a remarkable story of life, death, and revival&#x2014;told here for the first time in all its stunning color and bleak grays. The Death and Life of Monterey Bay begins in the eighteenth century when Spanish and French explorers encountered a rocky shoreline brimming with life&#x2014;raucous sea birds, abundant sea otters, barking sea lions, halibut the size of wagon wheels,waters thick with whales. A century and a half later, many of the sea creatures had disappeared, replaced by sardine canneries that sickened residents with their stench but kept the money flowing. When the fish ran out and the climate turned,the factories emptied and the community crumbled. But today,both Monterey&#x2019;s economy and wildlife are resplendent. How did it happen?<br> &nbsp;<br> The answer is deceptively simple: through the extraordinary acts of ordinary people. The Death and Life of Monterey Bay is the biography of a place, but also of the residents who reclaimed it. Monterey is thriving because of an eccentric mayor who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to use pistols, axes, or the force of law to protect her coasts. It is because of fishermen who love their livelihood, scientists who are fascinated by the sea&#x2019;s mysteries, and philanthropists and community leaders willing to invest in a world-class aquarium. The shores of Monterey Bay revived because of human passion&#x2014;passion that enlivens every page of this hopeful book.</p><p>Stephen R. Palumbi is the Director of the Hopkins Marine Station and the Jane and Marshall Steele Jr. Professor of Marine Science at Stanford University. Carolyn Sotka manages science and policy outreach activities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x2019;s Oceans and Human Health Initiative."[A] colorful history of times long gone, of environments degraded, of an intricate web of life threatened&#x2014;and how it has finally begun to recover through the hopeful work of communities and their leaders...[A] fascinating book, filled with anecdote and history, they explore the complex environment of the region, its fabulous sea life, and its colorful cast of humans." (<i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>"In this buoyant history of Monterey Bay, it's the humans, not the ocean life, that take center stage... the happy ending, so rare in nature literature nowadays, is refreshing." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Palumbi and Sotka bring to life a rich cast of characters from five centuries to tell the story of Monterey Bay's discovery, destruction, and redemption.

It's better now than a century ago, and the vision of what can happen when stubborn people set their minds to something makes this a story not just of a great place, but of inspiration that can work in many places." (Carl Safina, author of "Song for the Blue Ocean" and "The View From Lazy Point")<br><br>"Just as the Monterey Bay Aquarium now exhibits the wonders of marine life in the unique environment of Monterey Bay, Palumbi and Sotka turn back the pages of time to illuminate the fall and rise of the sea otter population; the lives of the local squid and abalones; the men and women who lived and worked there; the whales that came (and still come) to visit; the collapse of the sardine canneries; and how the dilapidated Hovden cannery was transformed into the best aquarium in America." (Richard Ellis, author of "The Empty Ocean" and "Tuna: A Love Story")<br><br>"[Explains] the incredible comeback of one of the most important locales for marine biodiversity [and details the] entertaining lessons on species interdependence and the quirky characters who helped the recovery happen." (<i>TreeHugger</i>)<br><br>"Fascinating" (<i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>)<br><br>"Palumbi and Sotka have taken the legacy Monterey Bay and created a model for successful ocean conservation: understand the ecology of the area, commit to marine protected areas, educate the public, be patient and persevere. Individual contributions might only be apparent in hindsight, but that does not make the many less significant. The story of Monterey Bay is not only a story of exploitation and collapse, but also one of resilience and hope."

He has appeared on the stage and in many films, including <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>. His other books include <i>Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu, Shooting the Actor</i>, and <i>Being an Actor</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> This scintillating follow-up to Callow's acclaimed <i>The Road to Xanadu</i> traces Welles's career from the triumphant premiere of Citizen Kane to his self-imposed exile to Europe in 1947. It was a pivotal period in the director's life, as his luster as Hollywood's boy wonder dimmed through a series of flawed&#x2014;if intermittently brilliant&#x2014;films, from <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> to <i>MacBeth</i>, that were snatched from his control and vandalized by frustrated studio executives. Eschewing the clich� of misunderstood genius persecuted by Tinseltown philistines, Callow assigns some of the blame to Welles's perpetual distraction with a plethora of projects (including a misbegotten scheme to become a radio comedian), the unfocused grandiosity of his artistic impulses and his directorial "strategy of simply shooting until the nature of the film finally declared itself." As he explores the tension between the director's compulsion to make art and Hollywood's need to run a business, the author interweaves fluent critiques of Welles's films and creative processes that are nuanced and perceptive. Callow's is a superbly written account of a magnetic personality and towering talent plagued by internal weaknesses and external friction, one that manages to shape the "Orsonic tornado" into an engrossing tragicomedy. <i>(Aug. 21)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the author of The New Men. 40,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Brian Murphy</b> is the author of <i>The New Men: Inside the Vatican's Elite School for American Priests.</i> A foreign correspondent for the Associated Press since 1993, and the AP's international religion writer since 2004, he lives in Athens, Greece.<blockquote><i>Oh, you painters who ask for a technique of color -- study carpets and there you will find all knowledge.</i><p><i> -- Paul Gauguin</i></p></blockquote><p><b>A Prologue: Madder and Bone</b></p><p>I came a long way to stand in a field of wild madder.</p><p>My driver stopped. I stepped off the one-lane road that pierced the dust bowl of central Iran. Then I walked down a path. It slithered atop a narrow ridge.</p><p>I liked that. It gives an idea of how I ended up here: definitely not a straight line and always struggling to keep some balance.</p><p>I had set out to write about carpets and the people who make them, sell them, cherish them, and, above all, see them with the same wonder that I do. At first, as a journalist, I poked around the edges of their lives on frequent assignments to Iran and Afghanistan, two important landmarks on the vast carpet map. But when I started to look more closely, I confronted the dilemma of any cartographer: what features to enhance and what details to omit. In other words, how do you find the right scale and relevance amid unlimited possibilities?</p><p>This is my attempt.</p><p>The things that intrigued me -- handwoven carpets, the art of making dyes from nature and the expressions of beauty and faith they produce -- already had an old and rich topography. There were imperial kings and swordsmen, folktales and cauldrons of steaming colors, lumbering caravans and cunning merchants. And -- perhaps most delightful of all -- mystic poets whose images dance in purple shadow and amber light. It could be rewarding enough just to explore the ground that others had covered and look for scraps and stories they had missed. But there was more out there if I searched harder. I had it on good authority.</p><p>A leafy little plant called madder told me so. I had been reading about its rich history as a dyestuff for carpets. Then I came across a quirky reference that is all but forgotten.</p><p>It can turn our bones red.</p><p>I first spotted this in a medical paper on skeletal development. It's now just an obscure footnote from nearly three centuries ago. But at the time -- as the Enlightenment was driving away medieval phantoms -- it caused a sensation and upended prevailing ideas about physiology. To me, this bit of historical flotsam was still impressive.</p><p>I decided madder would serve as my polestar. It would help me negotiate the noisy bazaars, musty workshops, distant villages, and other places I couldn't even yet imagine.</p><p>Madder seemed an ideal beacon to keep me on course. I could drift off on any detour in the carpet world and never really lose sight of madder's influence and the fiery palette held in its roots.</p><p>The bone story stayed my favorite. But I'd learn there were many others.</p><p>They flow generously from sources both illustrious and arcane. Madder's diary goes back as far as history's earliest written pages. And it most likely tumbles even further into the past.</p><p>The madder root -- dried and ground into dyers' powder -- was carried by Phoenician traders and mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Greek historian-wanderer Herodotus noted that it produced the striking vermilion shades on the goatskin cloaks of Libya's most elegant women. The Bible refers to madder as <i>pu'ah,</i> which some scholars believe was also a lullaby sound used to calm crying infants. To the Romans, it was <i>rubia,</i> which has endured as its scientific name. Pliny the Elder believed the most bountiful madder flourished in gardens near Rome.</p><p>Genus <i>Rubia,</i> family <i>Rubiaceae,</i> order <i>Rubiales.</i> The linguistic lineage fans out in many directions: ruby, rubric, rubella.</p><p>Alchemists pored over its properties in hopes of coaxing magic from nature. Artists made their canvases glow with madder-based glazes. As the Dutch master Jan Vermeer was finishing his famous <i>Girl with a Red Hat</i> in 1666, colonies were taking root across the Atlantic that would rebel a century later against the British crown. The soldiers of King George III sent to fight the American patriots wore madder-dyed red coats.</p><p>Healers, too, were drawn to the madder root's tentacles, which are full of swollen joints and crooked angles like those of an arthritic patient. The colors it bestowed must have seemed too powerful, too close to our own blood, to be medically benign. Extracts were prescribed -- with little recorded success -- for complaints ranging from jaundice to irregular menstruation to chronic bruising.</p><p>Then in about 1735 a British surgeon named John Belchier chronicled a remarkable observation. Animals fed madder leaves had red-tinged bones. And not everywhere. Only in the places where bones were growing and developing.</p><p>Belchier's research won him the prestigious Copley Medal and sharply redirected studies in anatomy. A prominent and ambitious London physiologist, John Hunter, led the pack toward the new frontiers in medicine. He extensively explored the use of madder in bone studies during a long career that included some unconventional offshoots. Hunter, according to some accounts, maintained dark alliances with grave robbers in order to get research cadavers. The stories claim he paid a substantial bribe in 1783 to obtain the body of the "Irish giant," Charles Byrne, who was more than eight feet tall and made a sad and meager living as a carnival freak. Byrne, shortly before his death, apparently caught wind of Hunter's plans. He reportedly tried to avoid Hunter's dissection table by requesting burial at sea inside a lead-lined coffin. But Hunter's resources and network were too strong. Byrne's skeleton remains in the collection of The Royal College of Surgeons of England along with other forensic oddities and relics of Hunter's age, such as a pig's skull stained a pinkish red from its madder diet.</p><p>Most may consider it all just an eccentric bit of pre-Victorian science. But I felt that Belchier's interplay of bone and madder was crying out for more attention. It seemed to me a rare convergence of the physical and mystical, a union, I believe, that also graces carpets. Madder -- coveted and used for millennia -- has this power to penetrate us so deeply and leave its mark so unmistakably. Carpets can do that, too, for those open to the possibilities.</p><p>I was lucky. I chose well. Madder led me -- with confidence and eloquence -- through the important first stages of my carpet education. It always had something important to say, and it tugged me along with one interesting connection after another: from texts on the craft of natural dye making, to the essential reds, peaches, and oranges produced by madder, then to its many guises throughout history, and on to Belchier's bones.</p><p>And, inevitably, to the madder plants at my feet.</p><p>Each step left sharp and perfectly formed footprints in the dry flatlands. In the distance, a jumble of low-slung buildings hugged the narrow road leading to the town of Ardakan, which sits on the southern fringe of an emptiness known as Dasht-e-Kavir, the Great Salt Desert.</p><p>It was early fall. There had been no rain for months. It's considered the best time to harvest madder. The mature plant is pulled up easily then. The roots hang in a jumble like a toddler's first scribbling. There are relatively few areas of wild madder left. Most growers prefer the cultivated <i>Rubia tinctorum,</i> known as the dyers' madder, which yields more powerful, color-rich powder. Wild madder is now more of a novelty or vestige of the plant's heyday that ended more than a century ago.</p><p>But it was something I needed to see. Wild madder is possibly the source for the shades of the earliest carpets. Red -- with its connotations of birth and mortality and the mysteries and yearnings in between -- has remained a fundamental color for carpet weavers. I felt it appropriate to pay my respects.</p><p>When I moved, clouds of tiny grasshoppers breached over the plants, then disappeared in the flame-shaped leaves with tiny barbs that grabbed at my ankles. I crouched low to give the illusion of the emerald green field rising up to swallow me, replacing the panorama of tan plains and the steel gray foothills.</p><p>The guide who brought me here grinds the dried madder root into coarse, rust-shaded powder. It's used by the wool and silk dyers who, for various reasons, still resist the easier and cheaper synthetic colors. This timeless process is under considerable pressure. Traditional dye masters were in steady decline until some carpet houses and other preservationists started efforts to revitalize the craft in the 1980s. Their interventions may have rescued natural dye making from becoming the stuff of hobbyists and concocted quaintness like the butter churners at country fairs.</p><p>In Iran, as recently as 2000, no more than 10 percent of new carpet production had naturally dyed material. Four years later, it was up to about 25 percent, said Majid Montazer, head of the dye division at the state-run Persian Carpet Research Center in Tehran.</p><p>"I would like to say it's because of some intellectual or cultural reawakening," he told me. "But it seems to be more about economics. This is what the customer wants. People are starting to understand that the natural dyes are just more attractive."</p><p>Considering the steamroller that calls itself progress, it's remarkable that the natural dyeing techniques were still around to save. Chemical colors have been commercially available since the mid-nineteenth century, constantly improving and supplanting the dye makers' livelihood and knowledge. Reds from the madder root. Yellows from pomegranate rind. Blues from the indigo plant. Browns from walnuts.</p><p>Chemical dyes may make sense from the perspective of the bottom line. Carpet making is, after all, a business, and businesses seek profits. But some wince at this equation. For them, something venerable and virtuous is being sacrificed. It's worth fighting back.</p><p>I sense a touch of this in Ali Akbari, who led me to the madder field. It's not sadness, exactly. But it's close. Maybe this was the look seen aboard clipper ships or in telegraph offices as the walls of the future began to close in. Akbari, a massive, moonfaced man constantly leaking sweat, wants to express...</p></p><h2>Harmonic Charts: Understanding and Using the Principle of Harmonics in Astrological Interpretation</h2><p>Explains the use of harmonic charts in astrology, tells how to interpret the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth charts, and discusses specific astrological cases</p><p></p><h2>The Museum of Broken Relationships</h2><p><b>"Leave[s] your heart feeling full and connected."</b><b>-- Frank Warren, <i>PostSecret</i></b><br><b>In the spirit of <em>Humans of New York</em> and <em>PostSecret</em>, MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS is a gorgeous gift book celebrating the objects that outlast love: a poignant, funny, sometimes bizarre and always delightful window into modern love and loss.</b><br>A postcard from a childhood sweetheart.

Now <em>The Oxford Reader's Companion to Trollope</em> brings together thirty-six leading scholars who provide an accessible, authoritative, and wide-ranging reference work on this important literary figure.<br> Here, in more than 500 A-Z entries, readers will find a wealth of information on Trollope's life, his works, and the historical and social context in which he lived. Trollope's writing career spanned almost half a century and his circle of friends reads like a who's who of Victorian England--and it's all captured here. The contributors offer illuminating essays on Trollope's major works--including the famed <em>Barsetshire Novels</em> and <em>Paliser Novels</em>--as well as on the many lesser known but no less accomplished books. The volume also examines Trollope's personal life, offering fresh information on such well documented aspects as his work at the Post Office and his famous circle of friends. Moreover, the contributors provide the most recent findings on aspects of Trollope's career only recently addressed by scholars: his work as a biographer and journalist, the importance of his extensive travels abroad, and the astonishing reappraisal of his work over the last few decades. And the <em>Companion</em> includes a chronology of Trollope's life, a family tree, maps, a thematic overview, and an extensive bibliography.<br> Packed with information based on the most current research, this attractively illustrated volume provides an unparalleled guide to one of the great nineteenth-century writers. It belongs on the shelf of everyone who loves English literature.</p><p><br><strong>R.C. Terry</strong> is Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia. He is the author of <em>Anthony Trollope: The Artist in Hiding</em> and <em>Victorian Popular Fiction 1860-1880.</em><br>Through a career that spanned nearly half a century, Trollope brought to his readers a humor, a gentle yet pointed insight, and a sense of scope uncommon in the Victorian era. He also had a huge circle of friends. Editor Terry (emeritus, Univ. of Victoria, and author of several Trollope books) provides an excellent guide to Trollope's large universe. In more than 500 alphabetical listings (in eight subject areas), 36 Trollope scholars profile his private and public life, his life as a writer, his characters, locations, and associations, and his literary and social contexts. Particularly noteworthy are their discussions of--and annotated entries about--each of Trollope's 47 novels, characters, and locations. They also track the change in Trollope's critical reception from his time to our own; a growing number of critics now see Trollope not just as the genial chronicler of a lost era but as a writer who tackled the controversial issues of his time--such as sexuality, feminism, and colonialism (all of which are addressed in this volume). The work is nicely rounded out with illustrations and photographs, a chronology, a family tree, and a detailed bibliography. This well-conceived volume is recommended for large public libraries and all academic libraries.<br><i>-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty.

His kingdom is in ruins, and when his subjects appeal for help, he only builds more tributes to his handsome face. His subjects are finally ready to stand up for themselves, and they have just the plan to get out of this hairy situation. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>A mustache....because sometimes good looks alone just aren't enough.<br></p><p><strong>Mac Barnett</strong> (www.macbarnett.com) is the author of several picture books, including <i>Oh No! Or How My Science Project Destroyed the World</i> and <i>Billy Twitters and His Blue Whale Problem</i>. He also writes the Brixton Brothers series of mysteries. Although he often neglects to shave, he has never worn a mustache. <br><br><strong>Kevin Cornell (</strong>www.bearskinrug.co.uk/) spends his days manicuring a magnificent beard, pausing only occasionally to illustrate from his Philadelphia home. Both he and his mustache have illustrated several books, including <i>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button: A Graphic Novel</i> and <i>The Trouble With Chickens</i>. You can visit him online at www.kevskinrug.com.Duncan, a "terribly handsome" king, spends each day "admiring his Royal Reflection, and not doing much else." His image is everywhere. Tired of living in a kingdom that is falling apart, the people demand much-needed services. He responds with a huge banner bearing you guessed it his own image. The next day a mustache appears on the banner, then on all the "Wanted!" posters seeking the perpetrator, and, finally, on every statue and billboard in the realm. It turns out all of his subjects have contributed their artistic talents to this task, and the enraged king jails them all. When life "as the only free man in all the land" becomes lonely and made worse by the sounds of laughter emanating from the jail, Duncan relents, gives up his imperious haughtiness, and paints a mustache on his own face. The large cartoon illustrations, mostly spreads, are framed in gold with a peacock motif along the bottom. The brief, humorous text appears in scrolls superimposed on the paintings. Though some pictures are so dark that details are difficult to see from afar, careful viewing reveals many visual jokes. The palace contains hilarious portraits and statues, including the king as Centaur. Beleaguered servants carry a giant mirror next to the king when he's out walking, and funny billboards abound. Despite its sheer silliness, this royal romp of a story contains some subtle messages behind the hilarity. Marianne Saccardi, formerly at Norwalk Community College, CT SLJ"<br><br>King Duncan is a rather good-looking guy. Unfortunately, his aesthetically appealing features do not necessarily translate into good governing skills (who knew?). In fact, King Duncan spends so much time admiring his royal visage that his kingdom is literally falling apart-towers crumble, potholes pepper roads, and playgrounds are health hazards, but King Duncan's best solution is to put up more banners depicting his kingly beauty. Finally fed up, his subjects take matters into their own hands, sneakily painting black mustaches on each royal caricature during the night, an act of rebellion that lands them all in jail. In order to accommodate so many prisoners, King Duncan is forced to build a larger jail-one that has complete towers, fully paved roads, and functional swings. The clever text will have leave youngsters giggling at the villagers' inevitable triumph at the king's expense, but the real appeal here lies in the illustrations with their cartoonish comedy and jokey details. Awash in vibrant color, the enjoyably overstuffed spreads are populated with plenty of hilarious but understated jokes (the signs of the protesting villagers are particularly amusing, and the mustaches are absurdly ubiquitous), inviting the viewer to pore over each page. A gilded peacock pattern frames each picture, completing the fractured fairy-tale feel. Youngsters will get a kick out of this kingly comedy, but you might want to hide the magic markers lest audiences follow the villagers' example on your other picture books. KQG BCCB"<br><br>King Duncan "spent every Royal Day admiring his Royal Reflection, and not doing much else. Which is why his kingdom was such a Royal Mess." When his subjects revolt, King Duncan's solution-yet another giant billboard of his royal visage, this one declaring, "I'm Great!"-forces them to use the graffitisti's most potent weapon: the scribbled mustache. Duncan, naturally, is outraged, and his attempts to ferret out the culprit result in even more absurdity. Barnett's (Oh No!: Or How My Science Project Destroyed the World) gift for humor is as sharp as ever, and Cornell (The Trouble with Chickens) holds his own in scenes filled with visual gags. Cornell has a particular love of signage (the angry mob's posters read, "Better Ladders for Potholes" and "Read Our Signs!") and statuary (the king is memorialized conquering such menaces as a surprised puffer fish and an apathetic walrus), and the half-lidded eyes of his subjects telegraph their frustration with their ruler. Barnett's light touch with the ending is just right, avoiding dreary moralizing. PW"<br><br>MUSTACHE! Barnett, Mac (Author); Cornell, Kevin (Illustrator) Ah, the endless pleasure of drawing little mustaches on pictures. When his subjects plead with vain King Duncan to fix their falling-apart kingdom, he responds by giving them the greatest gift of all: a giant portrait of himself slung from the castle walls. They are understandably underwhelmed. The next day a giant mustache adorns his royal face, and, furious, he has more posters of his likeness made up to plaster every free inch of the kingdom. And sure enough, every one of them soon sports a little black mustache. Who could have perpetrated such a crime? Well, everybody, it turns out, and after the king builds a kingdom-sized jail to adequately hold them all, loneliness eventually drives him to join in the spirit of the joke. The pompous king takes center stage in much of Cornell's cartoony artwork, but there's all kinds of great stuff going on in the periphery (including a jester who juggles battle-axes, babies, and hamburgers), ensuring plenty of repeat trips to watch Duncan get lampooned again and again. - Ian Chipman Booklist"<br><br>Barnett delivers a sweet slap to vanity. This king is neither toady nor tyrant, but he just can't get enough of himself. He gazes into the mirror that one of his retainers totes by his side, smitten and remiss. For as he takes in the royal visage, the royal roads are crumbling and the royal playground has broken swings-his kingdom is a wreck of neglect. "Enough!" cry his subjects, but all the king offers is a giant billboard of his face. That night, a giant mustache is painted on the royal puss. Outraged, the king wants the culprit flung in jail. The wanted posters, of course, feature the king's face. More mustaches materialize. "So he slouched in the Royal Throne. Look at my wonderful face, ' he said. Who could be doing this to me?' " Well, everyone. Cornell ushers the story forward with cinematic artwork, framed in elaborate medieval-like borders but paced sequentially like a comic book. As the town inadvertently re-creates itself-everybody admits their guilt, everybody must go to jail, which means a big expansion project for the prison, which results in a whole new village-there comes a bloodless revolution. The king can't beat them, so he joins them, clueless until the end, and kids will giggle all the way.

Outside it is still dark, 15 degrees with 33 inches of snow&#x2014;nearly a December record&#x2014;piled up and drifting as a stinging wind sweeps across the acres of parking lots.<br> <br>Inside the Janesville Assembly Plant, the lights are blazing, and the crowd is thick. Workers who are about to walk out of the plant into uncertain futures stand alongside pensioned retirees who have walked back in, their chests tight with incredulity and nostalgia. All these GM&#x2019;ers have followed the Tahoe as it snakes down the line. They are cheering, hugging, weeping.<br> <br>The final Tahoe is a beauty. It is a black LTZ, fully loaded with heated seats, aluminum wheels, a nine-speaker Bose audio system, and a sticker price of $57,745 if it were going to be for sale in this economy in which almost no one anymore wants to buy a fancy General Motors SUV.<br> <br>Five men, including one in a Santa hat, stand in front of the shiny black SUV holding a wide banner, its white spaces crammed with workers&#x2019; signatures. &#x201c;Last Vehicle off the Janesville Assembly Line,&#x201d; the banner says, with the date, December 23, 2008. It is destined for the county historical society.<br> <br>Television crews from as far away as the Netherlands and Japan have come to film this moment, when the oldest plant of the nation&#x2019;s largest automaker turns out its last.<br> <br>So the closing of the assembly plant, two days before Christmas, is well recorded.<br> <br>This is the story of what happens next.<br> <br><br> <br>Janesville, Wisconsin, lies three fourths of the way from Chicago to Madison along Interstate 90&#x2019;s path across America from coast to coast. It is a county seat of 63,000, built along a bend in the Rock River. And at a spot on the banks where the river narrows sits the assembly plant.<br> <br>General Motors started turning out Chevrolets in Janesville on Valentine&#x2019;s Day of 1923. For eight and a half decades, this factory, like a mighty wizard, ordered the city&#x2019;s rhythms. The radio station synchronized its news broadcasts to the shift change. Grocery prices went up along with GM raises. People timed their trips across town to the daily movements of freight trains hauling in parts and hauling away finished cars, trucks, and SUVs. By the time the plant closed, the United States was in a crushing financial crisis that left a nation strewn with discarded jobs and deteriorated wages. Still, Janesville&#x2019;s people believed that their future would be like their past, that they could shape their own destiny. They had reason for this faith.<br> <br>Long before General Motors arrived, Janesville was an industrious little city, surrounded by the productive farmland of southern Wisconsin. It was named for a settler, Henry Janes, and its manufacturing history began early. A few years before the Civil War, the Rock River Iron Works was making agricultural implements in a complex of buildings along South Franklin Street. By 1870, a local business directory listed fifteen Janesville carriage manufacturers. Along the river, a textile industry thrived&#x2014;wool, then cotton. By 1880, 250 workers, most of them young women, were weaving cloth in the Janesville Cotton Mills.<br> <br>As the twentieth century opened, Janesville was a city of about thirteen thousand&#x2014;descendants of the original settlers from the East Coast and immigrants over the decades from Ireland, Germany, and Norway. Downtown, Franklin and River Streets were lined with factories. Milwaukee and Main Streets were crowded with shops, offices, and, at one point, a saloon for every 250 residents. Stores stayed open on Saturday nights for farm families to come into town once their week&#x2019;s work was done. The bridge that carried Milwaukee Street over the river was still wooden, but electrified streetcars running north and south from downtown had replaced the old horse-drawn trolley service. Janesville was a railroad hub. Each day, sixty-four passenger trains, plus freight trains, pulled in and out of town. Raw materials arrived for factories, politicians for whistle-stop tours, and vaudeville stars for performances at the Myers Grand Opera House.<br> <br>In Janesville&#x2019;s long history of making things, two figures stand out. They are homegrown captains of industry, obscure to most Americans but legend to every Janesville schoolkid. They shaped the city&#x2019;s identity along with its economy.<br> <br>The first was a young telegraphy instructor in town named George S. Parker. In the 1880s, he patented a better fountain pen and formed the Parker Pen Company. Soon, Parker Pen expanded into international markets. Its pens showed up at world leaders&#x2019; treaty signings, at World&#x2019;s Fairs. Parker Pen imbued the city with an outsized reputation and reach. It put Janesville on the map.<br> <br>The second was another savvy businessman, Joseph A. Craig, who made General Motors pay attention to Janesville&#x2019;s talent. Near the close of World War I, he maneuvered to bring GM to town, at first to make tractors. Over the years, the assembly plant grew to 4.8 million square feet, the playing area of ten football fields. It had more than seven thousand workers in its heyday and led to thousands of jobs at nearby companies that supplied parts. If Parker Pen put Janesville on the map, GM kept it there. It proved that Janesville could surmount adversity under trying circumstances, seemingly immune to the blows of history. During the Great Depression, it closed&#x2014;and reopened a year later. During a sitdown strike, a seminal event in U.S. labor history, while autoworkers rioted elsewhere, peace held in Janesville. During World War II, the plant turned out artillery shells as part of the home front before postwar production resumed, greater than ever. Even as the auto industry&#x2019;s fortunes in the 1970s started to fade, dooming other plants, Janesville&#x2019;s assembly line moved on and on.<br> <br>So when the assembly plant stopped on a frozen December morning of 2008, how could people in town have known that this time would be different? Nothing in their past had prepared them to recognize that another comeback would not save them now.<br> <br>The work that vanished&#x2014;as many as nine thousand people lost their jobs in and near this county seat in 2008 and 2009&#x2014;was among 8.8 million jobs washed away in the United States by what came to be known as the Great Recession. This was, of course, not the first moment at which some American communities have hemorrhaged jobs in their defining industries. The textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, began to shut down or move to the South as early as World War I. Youngstown, Ohio&#x2019;s, Black Monday of 1977 began to erase an eventual fifty thousand jobs in steel and related industries. But this mighty recession&#x2014;the worst economic time since the 1930s&#x2014;stole American jobs, not in a single industry, not in a cluster of ill-fated communities, but up and down the economic ladder, from the East Coast to the West, in places that had never been part of the Rust Belt or any other bad economic belt and had never imagined that they would be so bruised. Places like Janesville.<br> <br><br> <br>Today, the assembly plant is padlocked behind a chain-link perimeter. Over the portico of the Art Deco main entrance, its logo is visible still. The logo is the outline of three gears, a different design in each one. In the right gear, the GM symbol. In the left, the crest of the United Auto Workers. Between them, a white field shaped like Wisconsin, with a candy pink heart near the bottom where Janesville sits. And in black letters across the top: JANESVILLE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER. The logo is starting to rust.<br> <br>Inside, the plant is dark. Its innards&#x2014;lathes to welders to five-ton hoists, all the equipment that a dead auto factory no longer needs&#x2014;have been picked over and auctioned off. Outside, the parking lots&#x2019; concrete acres are empty except for a security guard&#x2019;s lone sedan. Against the sky, smokestacks seem to go on forever, spewing nothing at all.<br> <br>Out back, nature has reclaimed an expanse where the rows of gleaming SUVs used to be parked before they were shipped away&#x2014;fields now, with saplings sprouting up. At the back entrance, a small sign is perched atop a guard&#x2019;s gate, missing a few letters: T FOR HE MEMORIES.<br> <br>Without its assembly plant, Janesville goes on, its surface looking uncannily intact for a place that has been through an economic earthquake. Keeping up appearances, trying to hide the ways that pain is seeping in, is one thing that happens when good jobs go away and middle-class people tumble out of the middle class. Along Racine Street, the route from the Interstate to the center of town, little American flags flutter from every street lamp. Main Street, with its nineteenth-century buildings of red and Milwaukee cream brick, retains its architectural grace. That some of its storefronts are vacant is nothing new; the mall began pulling business away from downtown in the 1970s. A recent Heart of the City Outdoor Art Campaign has splashed large pastel murals on the sides of downtown buildings, each mural commemorating one of Janesville&#x2019;s first decades, from its founding in 1836. The mural on the back of City Hall, illustrating the coming of the railroad through town in the 1850s, has a steam locomotive and a spike-driving man, and, lettered across the bottom, &#x201c;History. Vision. Grit.&#x201d;<br> <br>So Janesville goes on, yet it is altered. The change can be glimpsed from the many &#x201c;For Sale&#x201d; signs that appeared along residential streets, from the payday loan franchises that opened along the Milton Avenue commercial drag running north from downtown, from the enlarged space now occupied by the Salvation Army Family Center.<br> <br>And the citizens of Janesville? They set out to reinvent their town and themselves. Over a few years, it became evident that no one outside&#x2014;not the Democrats nor the Republicans, not the bureaucrats in Madison or in Washington, not the fading unions nor the struggling corporations&#x2014;had the key to create the middle class anew. The people of Janesville do not give up. And not just the autoworkers. From the leading banker to the social worker devoted to sheltering homeless kids, people take risks for one another, their affection for their town keeping them here.<br> <br>It is hard. The deserted assembly plant embodies their dilemma: How do you forge a future&#x2014;how do you even comprehend that you need to let go of the past&#x2014;when the carcass of a 4.8-million-square-foot cathedral of industry still sits in silence on the river&#x2019;s edge?<br> <br>Still, people cling to Janesville&#x2019;s can-do spirit. A month before the assembly plant closed, its managers and its United Auto Workers local announced together that the last Tahoe would be donated to the United Way of North Rock County and raffled off for charity. So many tickets, at $20 apiece or six for $100, were sold, so many of them to laid-off workers who didn&#x2019;t have a clue where their next paycheck would come from, that the raffle raised $200,460, pushing the United Way&#x2019;s annual campaign above its goal in the depths of the recession.<br> <br>The winning ticket went to a GM retiree who had worked at the plant for thirty-seven years and has so cherished the Tahoe that it seldom leaves his garage.</p><h2>Voices from the Warsaw Ghetto: Writing Our History (Posen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization)</h2><p><b>The powerful writings and art of Jews living in the Warsaw Ghetto</b><br><br> Hidden in metal containers and buried underground during World War II, these works from the Warsaw Ghetto record the Holocaust from the perspective of its first interpreters, the victims themselves.

Her sister Mary&#39;s ill health meant that the family moved around constantly for some years, living variously in Brighton, Buckinghamshire, France (Dieppe, Rouen, Paris, Tours, Poitiers, Angouleme, Bordeaux, Arcachon, Pau, Bagneres de Bigorre, and Dinan in Brittany), Spain and Germany, before settling for three years at Halstead Hall in Halstead in north-west Kent, a location which later inspired The Railway Children. When Nesbit was 17, the family moved again, this time back to London, living variously in South East London at Eltham, Lewisham, Grove Park and Lee. A follower of William Morris, 19-year-old Nesbit met bank clerk Hubert Bland in 1877. Seven months pregnant, she married Bland on 22 April 1880, though she did not immediately live with him, as Bland initially continued to live with his mother. Their marriage was an open one. Bland also continued an affair with Alice Hoatson which produced two children (Rosamund in 1886 and John in 1899), both of whom Nesbit raised as her own. Her own children were Paul Bland (1880-1940), to whom The Railway Children was dedicated; Iris Bland (1881-19??); and Fabian Bland (1885-1900), who died aged 15 after a tonsil operation, and to whom she dedicated Five Children And It and its sequels, as well as The Story of the Treasure Seekers and its sequels. Nesbit and Bland were among the founders of the Fabian Society (a precursor to the Labour Party) in 1884. Their son Fabian was named after the society. They also jointly edited the Society&#39;s journal Today; Hoatson was the Society&#39;s assistant secretary. Nesbit and Bland also dallied briefly with the Social Democratic Federation, but rejected it as too radical. Nesbit was an active lecturer and prolific writer on socialism during the 1880s. Nesbit also wrote with her husband under the name &#34;Fabian Bland&#34;, though this activity dwindled as her success as a children&#39;s author grew. Nesbit lived from 1899 to 1920 in Well Hall House, Eltham, Kent (now in south-east Greater London). On 20 February 1917, some three years after Bland died, Nesbit married Thomas &#34;the Skipper&#34; Tucker, a ship&#39;s engineer on the Woolwich Ferry.In this sequel to THE TREASURE SEEKERS, the Bastable siblings spend a summer making mischief in the English countryside. The wonderfully imaginative children form a society for the doing of good deeds--with unfailingly disastrous and amusing results. Their adventures (seamlessly abridged) are presented as vignettes with snatches of music in between. Teresa Gallagher sounds unerringly like children should sound. She's completely convincing as both the boys and the girls (and the grown-ups)--and she's particularly successful in the narrating voice of Oswald, who is the anonymous teller of these adventures. Edith Nesbit's strikingly modern British classic is just as welcome--and feels just as relevant--today.

It's a firsthand look at how the cutting-edge tech that makes the world work-touch screens, motion trackers, and even AI-made their way into our pockets.<br><i>The One Device</i> is a roadmap for design and engineering genius, an anthropology of the modern age, and an unprecedented view into one of the most secretive companies in history.

With the trademark brio, wit and authority that have made him our favorite writer of narrative non-fiction, he rolls out an unforgettable cast of vivid and eccentric personalities to bring to life a forgotten summer when America came of age, took centre stage and changed the world forever.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013:</strong> It&#x2019;s amazing what a talented writer at the top of his game can do with a seemingly narrow topic. The title of Bill Bryson&#x2019;s latest sums up the simplicity of his task: to document the &#x201c;most extraordinary summer&#x201d; of 1927, beginning with Charles Lindbergh&#x2019;s successful flight across the Atlantic. Even though we know many of these stories--Lindbergh&#x2019;s flight, Babe Ruth&#x2019;s 60-homerun season, the Mississippi River flood, Al Capone&#x2019;s bullet-ridden reign over Chicago--in Bryson&#x2019;s hands, and in the context of one amazing summer of twentieth-century ingenuity and accomplishment, they feel fresh, lively, and just plain fun. The book is so jammed with &#x201c;did you know it&#x201d; nuggets and fascinating origin stories (the opening of the Holland Tunnel, the first Mickey Mouse prototype, the source of the term &#x201c;hot dog&#x201d;), the effect is like sitting beside a brilliant, slightly boozy barstool raconteur, who knows a little bit about <em>everything</em>. From a tabloid murder trial to a flagpole-sitting record to the secret origins of the looming Great Depression, <em>One Summer</em> offers a new look at a transitional period in history, re-introducing us to such characters as Capone, Jack Dempsey, Al Jolson, Charles Ponzi, and Herbert Hoover. Ultimately, this is a book about the moment when important things, for good or ill, began happening in the US. With a giddy narrative voice and keen eye for off-kilter details, Bryson has spun a clever tale of America&#x2019;s coming of age. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>BILL BRYSON's bestselling books include <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, <i>I'm a Stranger Here Myself</i>, <i>In a Sunburned Country</i>, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> (which earned him the 2004 Aventis Prize), <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt</i><br><i>Kid</i>, and <i>At Home</i>.

Lovecraft&#39;s Book of Horror</h2><p>The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unkown. So writes H.P. Lovecraft, in his groundbreaking essay Supernatural Horror in Literature, which introduces this volume. In nine sections, Lovecraft, the acknowledged master of the genre, traces its evolution from ancient roots to the early Gothic, and through to the work of his American, British, and European contemporaries. Throughout, he cites the works he feels are of the first order, and from these the editors have selected twenty-one stories, each prefaced by Lovecraft&#39;s own opinions. Discover the eerie worlds of Clark Ashton Smith, which in Lovecraft&#39;s words are &#34;a universe of remote and paralyzing fright jungles of iridescent blossoms on the moons of Saturn, evil and grotesque temples in Adantis, Lemuria, and forgotten elder worlds...&#34; and the works of Arthur Machen, &#34;in which the elements of hidden horror and brooding fright attain an almost incomparable substance and realistic acuteness...&#34; Other selections include stories by M.R.. James, Ambrose Bierce, and Edgar Allan Poe. Lovecraft also identifies the best horror tales from writers famed for different work, such as Charles Dickens, R. L. Stevenson, Guy de Maupassant and E. F. Benson. This collection of Lovecraft&#39;s favorites is a feast of fear that no fan of the supernatural will be able to resist. Since, in the words of the master: &#34;Children will always be afraid of the dark and men with minds sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in unholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can glimpse.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Big Al</h2><p>Poor Big Al!

With financial assistance from a rich relative, it's purchased by 23-year-old Willie Traynor, formerly the paper's cub reporter. Soon afterward, his new business receives the readership boost it needs thanks to his editorial efforts and coverage of a particularly brutal rape and murder committed by the scion of the town's reclusive bootlegger family. Rather than shy from reporting on the subsequent open-and-shut trial (those who oppose the Padgitt family tend to turn up dead in the area's swampland), Traynor launches a crusade to ensure the unrepentant murderer is brought to justice. When a guilty verdict is returned, the town is relieved to find the Padgitt family's grip on the town did not sway the jury, though Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life in prison rather than death. But, when Padgitt is released after serving less than a decade in jail and members of the jury are murdered, Clanton once again finds itself at the mercy of its renegade family.<p> When it comes, the d�nouement is no surprise; <i>The Last Juror</i> is less a story of suspense than a study of the often idyllic southern town of Clanton, Mississippi (the setting for Grisham's first novel, <i>A Time to Kill</i>). Throughout the nine years between Padgitt's trial and release, Traynor finds acceptance in Clanton, where the people "don't really trust you unless they trusted your grandfather." He grows from a long-haired idealist into another of the town's colorful characters--renovating an old house, sporting a bowtie, beloved on both sides of the color line, and the only person to have attended each of the town's 88 churches at least once. <i>The Last Juror</i> returns Grisham to the courtroom where he made his name, but those who enjoyed the warm sentiment of his recent novels (<i>Bleachers</i>, <i>A Painted House</i>) will still find much to love here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, "The Ford County Times, went bankrupt. To the surprise and dismay of many, ownership was assumed by a 23 year-old college dropout, named Willie Traynor. The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper. <br>The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison. <br>But in Mississippi in 1970, "life" didn't necessarily mean "life," and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled. He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Ice in the Bedroom</h2><p>Freddie Widgeon wants the money to buy shares in a coffee plantation in Kenya so that he can marry Sally Foster.

At the turn of the millennium, we are witnessing the emergence of a vital&#x2014;perhaps viral&#x2014;new strain of female poetics: the &#x201c;Gurlesque,&#x201d; a term that describes writers who perform femininity in their poems in a campy or overtly mocking manner, risking the grotesque to shake the foundations of acceptable female behavior and language. Built from the bric-a-brac of girl culture, these works charm and repel: this work is fun, subversive, and important.

Big snowflakes fluttered slowly through the air like white feathers and made all of Heavenly Valley smooth and white and quiet and beautiful. Tall fir trees stood up to their knees in the snow and their outstretched hands were heaped with it. Trees that were bare of leaves wore soft white fur on their scrawny, reaching arms and all the stumps and low bushes had been turned into fat white cupcakes. Mrs. Monday's big, brick Boarding Home for Children wore drifts on its window sills, thick frosting on its steep slate roofs, big white tam o'shanters on its cold chimneys and by the light of the lanterns on either side of the big iron gates you could see that each of the gateposts wore a round snow hat. Even the sharp spikes of the high iron fencehad been blunted by the snow. &nbsp; However, in spite of its snowy decorations, in spite of the beauty of its setting, and even in spite of its being Christmas Eve, Mrs. Monday's was a forbidding-looking establishment. The fences were high and strong, the house was like a brick fortress and the windows, with the exception of one small one high up and almost hidden by the bare branches of a large maple tree, were like dark staring eyes. No holly wreath graced the heavy front door, no Christmas-tree lights twinkled through the windows and beckoned in the passer-by, no fragrant boughs nor pine cones were heaped on the mantel of the large cold fireplace, for Mrs. Monday, her niece Marybelle Whistle and all but two of her eighteen boarders had gone to the city to spend Christmas. Nancy and Plum Remson (Plum's real name was Pamela but she had named herself Plum when she was too little to say Pamela), the two boarders who remained, were left behind because they had no mother and father. No other place to go on Christmas Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You see, six years before, when Nancy and Plum were four and two years old, their mother and father had been killed in a train wreck and the children turned over to their only living relative, one Uncle John, an old bachelor who lived in a club in the city, didn't know anything about children, didn't want to know anything about children and did not like children. When the telegram from the Remsons' lawyer came notifying Uncle John of the tragic accident and the fact that he had just inherited two little girls, he was frantic.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Dreadful!" he said, fanning himself with his newspaper. "Gallivanting around the country getting killed. Dreadful and careless! Two little children! Heavens! What will I do with them? I'll have to move from this nice leather chair in this nice comfortable club and will probably wind up washing dishes and making doll clothes. Dreadful! Heavens!" Beads of sweat sprang out on his forehead like dew and he fanned himself some more. It was while he was folding his newspaper to make a bigger and better fan that he noticed the advertisement. It read:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>CHILDREN BOARDED--Beautiful country home with spacious grounds, murmuring brooks, own cows, chickens, pigs, and horses. Large orchard. Delicious home-cooked food. A mother's tender loving care. Year round boarders welcome. Rates upon request. Address Mrs. Marybelle Monday, Box 23, Heavenly Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>With trembling hands, Uncle John tore out the advertisement and wrote a letter to Mrs. Monday. He received an immediate answer and three days later he was on his way to inspect this delightful boarding home so chock-full of good food and tender loving care for little children.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was springtime in Heavenly Valley and the fields were golden with dandelions, the slopes were foaming with cherry blossoms, the sky was lazily rolling big white clouds around and meadow larks trilled in the thickets. Uncle John was entranced. "Had forgotten the country was so beautiful!" he said to his chauffeur. "Certainly the place for children. Beautiful, beautiful!"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When they drew up to the imposing entrance of Mrs. Monday's Boarding Home for Children, Uncle John was most impressed. "Nice, solid, respectable place," he said, noting the very large, sturdily built brick house surrounded by the high spiked iron fence."Well built," he said to his chauffeur, who had jumped out to open the heavy iron gates for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"It certainly is," the chauffeur said, wondering to himself why a boarding home for little children should have such a wicked-looking fence.

The meticulously detailed paintings of Carl Brenders, one of the world's most sought-after nature painters, combine with classic Christian poetry and quotations from Scripture and church leaders to form a rich source of inspiration for readers of all ages. These thirty-six wildlife illustrations are so realistically rendered they appear to be photographs. Brenders paints in the artistic tradition of John James Audubon and stands as equal beside such distinguished contemporaries as Roger Tory Peterson. The accompanying poems and quotations, taken from Christian writers throughout the ages, remind readers of God's purpose and order. <p>This lovely book is the perfect gift for young and old, for those who love art and those who love nature. It is a masterful celebration of God's handiwork that brings into focus the beautiful world in which he has placed us.</p></p><p>"The creation is quite like a spacious and splendid house, provided and filled with the most exquisite and at the same time the most abundant furnishings. Everything in it tells of God." -John Calvin <p>"God writes the Gospel, not in the Bible alone, but also on trees, and in the flowers and clouds and stars." -Martin Luther </p><p>Award-winning artist Carl Brenders is one of the world's most gifted nature painters. His meticulously detailed paintings-so realistically rendered they appear to be photographs-visually capture the beauty and care of God. </p><p>A selection of Brenders's finest paintings of North American wildlife are combined here with poems and quotations from some of the greatest Christian writers to inspire awe and wonder in readers of all ages. Song of Nature brings into focus our relationship to our creator and the beautiful world in which he has placed us. This stunning gift book will be a delight for young and old, for those who love art and those who love nature.</p>Carl Brenders, born in Belgium and educated at art schools in his native country, is one of the world&#39;s most accomplished nature painters. He has traveled often to the United States and Canada, visiting national parks and other preserved wilderness areas. Many of his paintings have been published as limited edition art prints.</p><h2>KunstHausWien</h2><p><p>"The architecture of the KunstHausWien is the first bastion against the false order of the straight line, the first bridgehead against the grid system and the chaos of the absurd", wrote Hundertwasser in autumn 1990, as finally a permanent site for his work was found. After four years of conversion work an old furniture factory in Vienna&#x2019;s third district has become the KunstHausWien, a colourful and exotic addition to Austria&#x2019;s museum landscape. It has 4000 sq. metres of exhibition space. Two of the four floors house changing exhibitions of international art, while the other two show a permanent exhibition of Hundertwasser&#x2019;s work.</p><p>This MuseumGuide reveals the unique architecture of the KunstHausWien and shows a representative choice of Hundertwasser&#x2019;s pictures, graphic work, tapestries, architectural models and stamps. It also contains various famous manifestos by the artist, such as "The third skin in the third district", "Window Dictatorship and the Window Right", "Tree Tenants are the Ambassadors of the Free Forests in the City", "Everything situated horizontally in the open air belongs to nature", and "The Uneven Floor".</p></p><p>Wieland Schmied (1929&#x2013;2014) has organized numerous exhibitions and was President of the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1995&#x2013;2004.

Doug Mahnke has pencilled Superman: Man of Steel and Allens: Stronghold. He is now the regular artist on JLA.In this originally six-issue <i>Batman</i> story arc, a figure from the Caped Crusader's past unexpectedly returns, forcing him to revisit the most tragic event of his crime-fighting career. The psychotic, disfigured Black Mask has seized control of Gotham City's criminal underworld, but his rule is challenged by the mysterious Red Hood, who has hijacked a crate full of 100 pounds of Kryptonite. The Kryptonite connection ensures that Superman puts in an appearance, as do Nightwing (the original Robin, Dick Grayson, now grown and fighting criminals on his own), Green Arrow, and the sorceress Zatanna. But this is essentially a Batman vehicle, as the Dark Knight gradually realizes, to his horror, whose face is under the hood (a revelation that will have more resonance for longtime readers). If Winick's portrayal of Batman lacks the panache provided by such more accomplished scripters as Jeph Loeb and Ed Brubaker, and if the art here is of similarly middling quality, at least the story has enough action and guest stars to grab loyal fans. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The luminous, richly rendered paintings that grace these pages all illustrate the book&#39;s fresh, timely approach that landscape painting represents a source of emotional and spiritual well-being, a fitting antidote to the hectic alienation of modern life, both for the artist who creates the work and the viewers who derive pleasure from looking at it. The author proposes that through his or her imagination, intellect, and feelings, an artist can evoke an emotional response in the viewer by the arrangement of the landscape&#39;s natural elements. In thoughtful examinations of her paintings, the author analyzes their color, time of day, season of year, climate and atmosphere, and the more elusive qualities that define this genre: a sense of place recognition and grace of line. The book is full of fresh insights that will enhance landscape painting for years to come.</p><p>Elizabeth Mowry has been named a Master Pastelist by the Pastel Society of America, and was awarded for her outstanding landscape work by the National Arts Club.

In <b>Snowball Earth</b>, gifted writer Gabrielle Walker has crafted an intriguing global adventure story, following maverick scientist Paul Hoffman&#x2019;s quest to prove a theory so audacious and profound that it is shaking the world of earth sciences to its core.<br><br>In lyrical prose that brings each remote and alluring locale vividly to life, Walker takes us on a thrilling natural history expedition to witness firsthand the supporting evidence Hoffman has pieced together. That evidence, he argues, shows that 700 million years ago the Earth did indeed freeze over completely, becoming a giant &#x201c;snowball,&#x201d; in the worst climatic catastrophe in history. Even more startling is his assertion that, instead of ending life on Earth, this global deep freeze was the trigger for the Cambrian Explosion, the hitherto unexplained moment in geological time when a glorious profusion of complex life forms first emerged from the primordial ooze.<br><br>In a story full of intellectual intrigue, we follow the irascible but brilliant Hoffman and a supporting cast of intrepid geologists as they scour the planet, uncovering clue after surprising clue. We travel to a primeval lagoon at Shark Bay in western Australia, where dolphins cavort with swimmers every morning at seven and &#x201c;living rocks&#x201d; sprout out of the water like broccoli heads; to the desolate and forbidding ice fields of a tiny Arctic archipelago seven hundred miles north of Norway; to the surprising fossil beds that decorate Newfoundland&#x2019;s foggy and windswept coastline; and on to the superheated salt pans of California&#x2019;s Death Valley.<br><br>Through the contours of these rich and varied landscapes Walker teaches us to read the traces of geological time with expert eyes, and we marvel at the stunning feats of resilience and renewal our remarkable planet is capable of. <b>Snowball Earth i</b>s science writing at its most gripping and enlightening.</p><p>GABRIELLE WALKER earned a Ph.D. in natural sciences from Cambridge University.

Look around you, take in the intricate complexities of life on Earth, and then consider this: complex life is a very recent invention. Our home planet spent most of its long history coated in nothing but simple, primordial slime. For billions of years, the only earthlings were made of goo.<br><br>Then, suddenly, everything changed. At one abrupt moment roughly 600 million years ago, something shook the Earth out of its complacency. From this came the beginnings of eyes, teeth, legs, wings, feathers, hair and brains. Every insect, every ape and antelope, every fish, bird and worm. Whatever triggered this new beginning was ultimately responsible for the existence of you and everyone you've ever known.<br><br>So what was it?<br><br>Paul Hoffman, part-time marathon runner, full-time geologist, and obsessive, intense seeker of glory, thinks he knows. He believes he has finally struck science gold. Now a full professor at Harvard University and a world-renowned scientist, he has uncovered evidence for the biggest climate catastrophe the Earth has ever endured. And from that disaster, according to Paul, came a remarkable new redemption.<br><br>Shark Bay shows up from the air as a snag in the smooth coastline of Western Australia. Five hundred miles north of Perth, it lies just at the place where tropical and temperate zones rub shoulders. The area around the bay is a powerful reminder of how far we have come since primordial slime ruled the world. It is full of varied, vivid life.<br><br>This is one of the few places in the world where wild dolphins commune with humans, every day, regular as clockwork. At 7:00 a.m. each day a park ranger dressed in khaki uniform emerges from a wooden hut to focus a pair of binoculars on the horizon. Perhaps half an hour later, he'll spot the first dolphin fin. Somehow the word immediately spreads. Where there were only four or five people on the sandy beach, suddenly fifty or sixty appear.<br><br>Three harassed rangers do their best to marshal them into an orderly line. Everyone will get a chance to see the dolphins. No one will be permitted to touch them. No one must go more than knee-deep in the water. Another ranger deftly diverts the enormous wild white pelicans away from the beach by flicking on a water sprinkler. The birds flock around with gaping jaws--in this desert landscape, fresh water is irresistible.<br><br>The dolphins and their calves arrive. One of the rangers, a wireless headset amplifying her voice, wades up and down in front of the spectators, introducing the dolphins ("This is Nicky and Nomad, Surprise and her calf Sparky") and reciting useful dolphin facts. The crowd surges into the water, like acolytes seeking a Jordanian baptism, their expressions beatific.<br><br>The dolphins are the crowd pullers--more than six hundred of them live here. But Shark Bay is also famous for the rest of its wildlife. The bay contains more than 2,600 tiger sharks, not to mention hammerheads and the occasional great white. The tigers show up in the water as streamlined shadows up to twelve feet long; often they are skulking beside patches of sea grass in the hope that dinner will emerge in the form of a blunt-nosed, lumbering gray dugong. Dugongs, or sea cows, are supposedly the creatures behind the mermaid myths, though I can't see it myself. They are too prosaic, placidly chewing away at the end of a "food trail," a line of clear water that they have cut, caterpillar-like, through the fuzzy green sea grass. They're exceptionally shy and rare, but here, among the largest and richest sea-grass meadows in the world, are a staggering ten thousand of them--tiger sharks notwithstanding.<br><br>Then there are sea snakes, green turtles, and migrating humpback whales. And just a little to the north, where the tropics begin in earnest, lies Coral Bay--one of the world's top ten dive sites. Come and dive the Navy pier! See more than 150 species of fish! Also sea sponges and corals, brilliant purple Xatworms, snails and lobsters and shrimp. And the vast, harmless whale sharks, the world's biggest Fish. And on land there are wallabies and bettongs and bandicoots, emus and kangaroos and tiny, timid native mice.<br><br>There's everything in this region, from the wonderful to the plain weird. Evolution has been tweaking, adapting and inventing new forms of complex life for hundreds of millions of years, and here in Western Australia it surely shows.<br><br>But this is also a place where you can travel back in time, to see the other side of the evolutionary equation--the simplest, most primitive creatures of all. They come from the very First moments in the history of life, just after the dust from the Earth's creation had settled. And when these First fumblings of life appeared on Earth's surface, their form was exceedingly unprepossessing. Throughout oceans, ponds and pools, countless microscopic creatures huddled together in a primordial sludge. They coated the seaXoor, and inched their way up shore with the tide; they clustered around steaming hot springs, and soaked up rays from the faint young sun. Dull green or brown, excreting a gloopy glue that bonded them together into mats, these creatures were little more than bags of soup. Each occupied a single cell. Each had barely mastered the rubrics of how to eat, grow and reproduce. They were like individual cottage industries in a world that had no interest in collaboration or specialization. They were as simple as life gets.<br><br>Although these primitive slime creatures have now been outcompeted in all but the most hostile environments, a few odd places still exist where you can experience the primeval Earth firistband. The acidic hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, for instance, or Antarctica's frigid valleys. And here, in Western Australia, where countless microscopic, single-celled, supremely ancient creatures are making their meager living in one small corner of Shark Bay: a shallow lagoon called Hamelin Pool. The pool's water doesn't mix much with the rest of the bay, and it's twice as salty as normal. Since few modern marine animals will tolerate so much salt, this is one of the last refuges of ancient slime.<br><br>The sign pointing to Hamelin Pool is easy to miss, even on the desolate road running south from Monkey Mia. On the second pass I Finally spot it, turn left, and bump along a sand track with scrubby bush to either side. For this first visit I avoid the restored telegraph station with its tiny museum and tea shop, and head straight for the beach. I want to experience primordial Earth without a guide.<br><br>There's an empty parking lot of white sand, with wattles and low-slung saltbushes clinging to the surrounding dunes, and a path threading through the bushes toward the sea. Though I've come to find the world's simplest creatures, the complexities of life are everywhere. From one of the bushes a chiming wedgebill incessantly reiterates its five-note melody. From another, a gray-crested pigeon regards me unblinkingly. The shells of the beach crunch underfoot; they are tiny, bone-white, and perfectly formed, and the bivalves that grew them are eons of evolution ahead of the simple creatures that I'm seeking. I step onto the boardwalk, which stretches like a pier out into the water. Each weathered plank of wood contains row upon row of cells that once collaborated in a large, complex organism. Signs on all sides show pictures of the slime creatures with smily faces and cheery explanations of their origin. Flies buzz infuriatingly around my head, landing on my face to drink from the corners of my eyes. Black swifts swoop between the handrails, and butterXies the color of honey, with white and black tips to their wings. Time travel is harder than it looks. The modern world is right here even in Hamelin Pool, and it's stubbornly refusing to leave.<br><br>I retreat to the telegraph station to plead with the ranger for permission to leave the boardwalk and wade out into the pool. He hesitates and then relents. "Go along the beach to the left," he says. "Don't step on the mats. Be careful." The mats he's talking about are one of the signs of primeval Earth. They are slimy conglomerates of ancient cyanobacteria, and they grow painfully slowly. At the beginning of the last century, horse-drawn wagons were backed into the sea over the mats, to unload boat cargo. A hundred years later the tracks they left are still visible as bare patches in the thin black sludge. An injudicious footprint here will last a long time. I promise to watch my step.<br><br>I return to the beach and this time walk carefully toward the water's edge. More striking than the ubiquitous patches of sludgy, foul-smelling bacterial mats are the "living rocks" in between. These strange denizens of Slimeworld are everywhere, an army of misshapen black cabbage heads marching into the sea.<br><br>The ones highest up the shore are now nothing more than dead gray domes of rock, shaped like clubs, perhaps a foot tall. They once bore microbial mats on their surfaces, but these have long since shriveled, abandoned by the receding water. Closer to the Pool's edge the domes are coated with black stippling that will turn to dull olive green when the tide washes over them. Most of the stromatolites, though, lie in the water, stretching out as far as I can see. Between them the sand is draped with black-green mats of slime, and checkered with irregular patterns of sunlight as the waves ripple overhead. I wade up to my knees among these strange formations, basking in the sunshine. There is nobody else in sight.<br><br>The living rocks of Slimeworld are called "stromatolites," a word that comes from the Greek meaning "bed of rock." Though the interior of the stromatolites is plain, hard rock, their outer layers are spongy to the touch. Here on the surface is where the ancient microbes live. They're sun-worshipers: by day they draw themselves up to their full Wlamentous height--perhaps a thousandth of an inch--soak up the sun, and make their food; by night they lie bac...</p><h2>The Straight Lead: The Core of Bruce Lee&#39;s Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do</h2><p><b>"The straight punch is the core of Jeet Kune Do."&#x2014;Bruce Lee</b><br><br>The straight lead was a key element in Bruce Lee's development of his own personal style.

In the tradition of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, Rachel draws upon symbols, myths, and folk tales both ancient and modern, to illuminate the spiritual truths behind the Tarot's symbols. <br> <br><i>The Forest of Souls </i>unfolds like a dream, in a series of musings upon the confluence of the sacred and the mundane. How can a simple deck of 78 cards become keys unlocking life's greatest secrets? While the most common use of Tarot is for divination, Rachel shows how to use the cards for readings of an entirely different nature. Asking improbable, even impossible questions, she plays with the sacred possibilities and answers that the Tarot gives us. What nourishes my soul? What is soul? What is Tarot? What plan did God follow to create the universe? <br> <br>We now know that the Tarot was almost certainly not originally designed to include Kabbalistic and other occult correspondences. Yet such systems can greatly enhance our understanding of and relationship with the cards. Embracing paradox &nbsp;and non-linear thinking allows us to push the boundaries of the known and venture into the unknown. It is in that sacred space that we open ourselves to wonder and mystery. <br> <br></p><p>Rachel &nbsp;is considered one of the World&#x2019;s foremost authorities on the modern interpretation of the Tarot. She is also a poet, an award-winning novelist, and a Tarot card and comic book artist. She has published 12 books on the Tarot, including 78 Degrees of Wisdom (Thorsons, 1998), considered a modern classic and &#x201c;the Bible of Tarot reading.&#x201d; Its&#x2019; marriage of common sense, wide-ranging knowledge, and esoteric awareness have inspired many tens of thousands of readers worldwide to a deeper knowledge of the Tarot. <br> <br>She is a member of the American Tarot Association, the International Tarot Society, and the Tarot Guild of Australia. With fellow Tarot author Mary Greer, she has taught at the famed Omega Institute for the past twelve years. She has been conferred the title of &#x201c;Tarot Grand Master&#x201d; by the Tarot Certification Board, an independent body located in Las Vegas, Nevada. <br> <br>As a fiction writer, Pollack has been bestowed many honors and awards, among them the famed Arthur C. Clarke Award for Science Fiction (for Unquenchable Fire) and the World Fantasy Award (for Godmother Night). She is a recommended member of PEN International, and has written for numerous publications. <br> <br><b>Myths of Origin <br> <br></b>Where does it come from? No matter how we treat the subject--whether we dive deep into the symbolic mysteries, or recite formulas for fortunetelling, or play with the pictures--we cannot escape the question. There are certainly enough answers. Enter the world of Tarot and stories of its origin move around you like excited birds. Here is a sample. <br> <br>The Tarot depicts the sacred myths of the Romany (or Gypsies), disguised in cards for the centuries of exile from the Rom homeland in India--or Egypt--or outer space. The Tarot is a Renaissance card game inspired by annual carnival processions called triumphs. The Tarot is a card game derived from annual processions called thriambs, in honor of the God Dionysus, the creator of wine. The Tarot conceals/reveals the secret number teachings of Pythagoras, a Greek mystic who lived at the time of Moses, and who influenced Plato. The Tarot depicts the secret oral teachings of Moses, who received them directly from God. The Tarot contains the lost knowledge of Atlantis, a drowned continent first described by Plato. The Tarot is a card game imported from Palestine and Egypt during the Crusades. The Tarot is a vast memory system for the Tree of Life, a diagram of the laws of creation. The Tarot hides in plain sight the wisdom of the Egyptian God Thoth, master of all knowledge. The Tarot shows Egyptian temple initiations. The Tarot shows Tantric temple initiations. The Tarot preserves the wisdom of Goddess-initiated witches during the long, dark centuries of patriarchal religion. The Tarot maps the patterns of the Moon in Chaldean astrology. The Tarot was created by papermaker guilds who were the last remnants of the Cathars, Christian heretics brutally suppressed by the Church of Rome. <br> <br>All of the above, and more, Tarot writers have proclaimed as the one, true, authentic origin of the Tarot. <br> <br>The great mythographer Joseph Campbell once commented that the world is full of creation stories and all of them are wrong. The Tarot is like that: full of origin stories, and probably all of them wrong. They are wrong because they take a compelling idea as literal truth. Wrong because they need that literal belief to take the idea seriously, and if someone should disprove once and for all these origin tales they will have lost their hold on its meaning and value. But if we can learn to take these origin tales as myths, as divine play, then not only can we let go of this need to prove the superiority of one to all others, we also can appreciate the poetic truth of each one. And we can marvel at this amazing work, this pack of seventy-eight pictures that somehow adapts itself to so many spiritual and historical traditions. <br> <br>The Tarot''s Secret Origin is part of its myth. One of the most remarkable things about the cards is the way people snapped at this idea the moment it appeared and have clung to it tenaciously ever since. Here is a personal story. Years ago I was in Denmark shortly after the publication of the Danish edition of my book Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom. Two radio stations wanted to interview me. The first, on national radio, went very well. The second was for a New Age program and I looked forward to it as a chance to discuss the Tarot in some more depth. The day before, the host called me to go over some topics. When I told him that I did not believe the Tarot came from Atlantis, or that secret occult masters crafted it and disguised it as a game, he canceled my appearance. <br> <br>Though we cannot determine the exact origin of the cards, we can, in fact, pinpoint the origin of the myth. In the 1770s and 80s a man named Antoine Court de G�belin published a nine-volume study of esoteric ideas called Le Monde Primitif (The Primitive World). The very idea of a primitive human state is itself a myth. In our time, the term "primitive" suggests people unformed, ignorant, savage. In earlier times it meant the opposite, a supposed golden age in which people knew spiritual truth and lived in perfect peace. The Garden of Eden is a variation on this myth. <br> <br>In the course of his work, Court de G�belin visited a friend, Madame la C. d''H., who showed him the latest fad, an Italian card game popular in the southern countries, called in Italy tarocchi, and in France les tarots. Court de G�belin looked through the bright pictures and had an epiphany. The ordinary card game was, in fact, a disguised great work of occult mystery. He called it the Book of Thoth, the very sum of all knowledge. <br> <br>Thoth was an Egyptian God, the quintessential master of wisdom. Thoth guided the boat of the Sun God Ra across the sky, he invented mummification to resurrect the slain God Osiris, he helped judge dead souls for the afterlife, he even gambled with the Moon to create extra days for the year (more about that story in awhile). The Greeks linked Thoth with their own Hermes, God of magic, healing, wisdom, science, commerce, and, not incidentally, patron of swindlers and thieves (you have to love a religion with a God of swindlers). <br> <br>Much of the esoteric tradition originates with a shadowy figure known as Hermes Trismegistus, or Thrice-great Hermes, author of The Emerald Tablet, a work composed in Alexandrian Egypt in the early Christian era. The myth of the Emerald Tablet considers Hermes Trismegistus another name for Thoth. Now Antoine Court de G�belin had described the Tarot as an even more fundamental divine work than the Emerald Tablet itself. Thoth, he said, had given the symbolic pictures to his human disciples and disguised them as a game so it could move through the centuries undetected. <br> <br>What a wonderful idea! And how amazing that this moment''s inspiration took such a powerful hold on people''s imaginations that it reverberates to this day. Court de G�belin and his nine volumes would be long forgotten were it not for this one short essay in volume eight. The compelling part of the myth was not really the claim of Egyptian beginning. That was just the particulars. The core idea, the one that took hold so powerfully it dominates subsequent origin stories (at least the occult ones), is that the Tarot forms the basis of all knowledge, the key of keys, or "clavicle," as occultists sometimes call it. In other words, the Tarot lies behind all other knowledge systems. The Tarot summarizes all the mysteries and discoveries of ancient masters. Know the Tarot, understand it correctly, and you will know everything. When Tarot interpreters say it is not Egyptian but Hebrew, or not Hebrew but Tantric, or Chaldean, or heretical Christian, or Wiccan, they begin with the same assumption--that whatever the origin, the Tarot must contain ultimate secrets. They may argue over just which secrets it contains, but they never doubt its esoteric significance. <br> <br>If we let go of literal belief in all these stories, if we accept the strong likelihood that the Tarot began in the fifteenth century as a popular card game with common allegorical images, do we lose the value of the myth? Can we play with myth rather than believe in it? It seems to me, and to many modern Tarotists, that we actually gain when we see the Tarot''s multiple origins as stories rather than history. For one thing, we can stop arguing, stop trying to prove our version of the origin is correct. Instead, we can look at the subtle beauty and inner truths of the varied esoteric systems entwined with the Tarot. <br> <br>One of the major traditions looks at the Tarot as a representation of Kabbalah, a vast system of Jewish mystical ideas and practices. We will look at how this idea originated in a moment, but for now there is a Kabbalist myth that illuminates the question of literal belief. The Kabbalists teach that the universe exists in ten levels of divine energy, called sephiroth (the word is connected to "sapphire"). They picture these sephiroth in various ways, sometimes as concentric circles with God in the center and the physical world at the outermost circle, or more commonly with the sephiroth arranged as small circles on a Tree of Life, with the ultimate energy at the top sephirah, called Kether (Hebrew for "crown"), and the material universe at the bottom, called Malkuth ("kingdom"). God created Adam, the first human, with the ability to see and understand all the levels. However, Adam looked at the beauty of Malkuth and allowed himself to mistake it for all creation. And so Adam "sinned," and lost the closeness to God, and took us all with him. Or maybe we ourselves repeat Adam''s error of our own free will, and continuously confuse the material world with the whole of existence. <br> <br>A literal belief in any particular origin for the Tarot seems to me a little like Adam''s great mistake. We become entranced by the claim and lose sight of the poetic levels and what they actually can teach us. Similarly, if we debunk the specific assertions--if we say no, the Tarot did not come from Egypt, or Atlantis, or ancient rabbis--we would make a great error to think such beliefs no longer mean anything. <br> <br>The link of Tarot and Kabbalah also goes back to Le Monde Primitif, and a certain Comte (Count) de Mellet, who wrote a backup essay to Court de G�belin''s comments on the Tarot. Court de G�belin wrote that "the set of XXI or XXII trumps, the XXII letters of the Egyptian alphabet common to the Hebrews and the Orientals, which also served as numerals, are necessary in order to keep count of so many countries" (quoted in A Wicked Pack of Cards, Decker, Depaulis, and Dummett). Contrary to popular belief about the Egyptian hieroglyphs, they are indeed an alphabet, and not picture writing. However, there are not twenty-two of them. Nor can we determine just who "the Orientals" might be. The Hebrew alphabet, on the other hand, does indeed have twenty-two letters, and Jewish mystical thought considers them the very basis of existence. They link up the sephiroth emanations on the Tree of Life via twenty-two pathways, each with the special quality of one of the letters. Just as Court de G�belin said, they have numerical value, so that each word adds up to a number, and we can discover secret connections in pairs of words that have the same numbers (this practice is called gematria). We also can move through mystical worlds with the letters and perform acts of magic using the divine names and other letter combinations. It was the Comte de Mellet''s idea to link each Tarot trump to a particular Hebrew letter, so that the individual cards would take on the magical powers of the letters. <br> <br>Tarot scholar and teacher Mary K. Greer has suggested an interesting revisionist history of the articles in Le Monde Primitif. Court de G�belin and de Mellet were both Freemasons. Greer considers it likely that the Masons had developed the esoteric theory of Tarot over some time, and gave permission to the two writers to make it public (she also thinks it likely that de Mellet''s essay came first). For Greer, Madame la C. d''H. was a cover story. If Greer is correct in her speculations, it still does not diminish the remarkable impact the announcement had on the history of Tarot. <br> <br>Christian mystics and magicians became interested in Kabbalah around the same time as the first appearance of the Italian card game tarocchi, so it is not impossible that the Tarot indeed derived from Kabbalistic ideas (though modern scholarship suggests that the cards existed a few decades before the first Christian use of Kabbalah). And the structural comparisons are indeed impressive. Twenty-two is not as common a mystical number as, say, twenty-one (numerologists describe twenty-two as a "master" number, but this is probably a Kabbalistic influence). Kabbalah describes four distinct worlds of creation, each with ten sephiroth. In Tarot we find four suits with cards Ace-Ten. Kabbalah also makes much of the mystical meaning of the four letters in God''s most holy name. And the Tarot has four court cards, Page, Knight, Queen, and King, in each suit. No wonder the idea took hold so powerfully. <br> <br>In the nineteenth century an occultist and magician named Eliphas L�vi (originally Alphonse Louis Constant) developed the Kabbalistic symbolism of the Tarot in great detail, especially for the trump cards and their Hebrew letters. At the end of the century a Rosicrucian group with the wonderful name of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn took L�vi''s work and expanded and revised it to construct a magical universe of Kabbalah, ritual, Pagan Gods, Hindu philosophy, Freemasonry and other occult traditions, astrology, alchemy, and secret names. The key to all this, the key of keys that would enable the highest adepts (adept was a favorite word and there were many levels) to move through all these different worlds of consciousness and magical power was--of course--the Tarot. Antoine Court de G�belin had claimed it as the Book of Thoth. Eliphas L�vi had made it the embodiment of the Hebrew letters. Now the Golden Dawn made these beliefs a reality, or at least a fully developed system. <br> <br>Did it matter that there was no historical evidence for a Kabbalist, or for that matter an Egyptian origin for the Tarot? It does if you need to believe in the literal truth of your magical system. The Golden Dawn included poets, artists, scholars, even a scientist or two. For such an intellectual group they seem to have been remarkably gullible. One of the founders, Samual Liddell "MacGregor" Mathers, produced the group''s official Tarot deck, which differed in some interesting ways from the traditional cards. <br> <br>Apparently, one evening Mathers took a set of blank cards, went into a room for a short time, and emerged with a complete deck of painted cards. This was enough to convince the group of the deck''s divine inspiration. It does not seem to have occurred to them that Mathers (or possibly his wife Moina) might have painted seventy-eight pictures in the usual manner and concealed them somewhere in the room. <br> <br>But then the Order''s founders, Mathers, Dr. Wynn Westcott, and Rev. W. R. Woodman, based the whole thing on a fraud. They claimed to have received a "cypher manuscript" that included a page with information about a Frau Sprengel in Germany, who could authorize them to start an English branch of a secret mystical order. After decades of debate, scholars such as Israel Regardie (himself a former member of the Golden Dawn) demonstrated that Frau Sprengel never existed. Westcott himself seems to have written the vital page. Does such proof discredit the Golden Dawn and all its productions? The word hermetic in the title comes from Hermes Trismegistus, but ultimately from that Greek God of swindlers. Hermes might have delighted in such a daring enterprise. Perhaps the Order''s great success owes much to Hermes'' blessing. <br> <br>A personal story. While I was writing the above paragraphs, my dog, whose name is Wonder, decided to chew up one of my decks of cards, something she never has done before (or since). To do this she had to pull the cards off a table, then bite off the silk scarf that enwrapped them, and scatter the cards about the floor. She actually chewed up only one card before she returned to the room where I sat at my desk. When I discovered what she had done (and gotten over the shock), I checked to see which card she had destroyed. The deck is not Tarot, but an Egyptian-based oracle called the Book of Doors, and the card that Wonder chewed up was called Kerhet, after an Egyptian Goddess of secret initiation. Secret initiations were the Golden Dawn''s whole manner of operation. <br> <br>The deck''s writers, Athon Veggi and Alison Davidson, write of this card that "the quality of secrecy is recognized in the oath to Keep Silent, to keep the creative operation in perfect secrecy." The Golden Dawn took this concept so seriously that members took...</p><h2>Tomb Raider: The Art of Survival</h2><p>Follows the journey of the Tomb Raider game from page to screen.

My mother had bought it in Morocco many years ago, and as a child, I admired it in secret, stroking the tiny pieces of mother-of-pearl inlay on the surface, its patterns conjuring faraway places. Its ivory keyhole held a key with a striped ribbon attached. Turning the key always produced a soft&nbsp;pling-plong,&nbsp;but never opened the box. After many decades, my eighty-five-year-old mother was tired of Maine winters and was moving to Arizona. Parceling out her possessions and the memories they held to her five surviving children, she now held the box out to me, saying simply, &#x201c;Your father&#x2019;s letters.&#x201d;</p><p>I had always suspected that the box held them. Exotic and mysterious, it was the perfect receptacle for the treasured relics of a husband long dead and a father I had never known. It contained a chapter of my mother&#x2019;s life that she had closed long since, one I was reluctant to re-open. The moment was freighted with feeling; her expression suggested things that I was afraid I could respond to only with tears. Neither of us felt comfortable in such emotional territory, and we cut it short. I stowed the box tenderly in the car along with the other pieces of her life she had<br>designated for me: a miscellany of books, pictures, rugs, silver. As the car pulled away, she stood, small and contained, the enormous firs by the garage dwarfing her as she waved good-bye. Behind her, morning sunlight skittered across the bay.</p><p>At home the box sat&#x2014;still beautiful, but still steadfastly, stubbornly locked&#x2014;keeping its secrets. Though my mother had given it to me, I felt that breaking this family reliquary open by force was wrong. Besides, I was reluctant to discover what the box held. Inside was the person who had changed the shape of my mother&#x2019;s life, whom my older brothers and sisters loved and remembered, a real person to everyone in the family except me, the youngest. For years his mythical presence had loomed large, but as an absence&#x2014;an immense absence. Time had gradually healed my mother&#x2019;s wounds, but I was wary of causing pain by asking about him. In fact, I realized that I bore some resentment toward the man I had held responsible for many miseries.</p><p>My mother had moved on, but for me he remained unfinished business. Opening the box&#x2014;resurrecting him&#x2014;would mean finding not only the man who became my father, but also the man responsible for the &#x201c;Nazi!&#x201d; a first-grade classmate had yelled at me as a six-year-old, newly arrived in the States from Germany. I didn&#x2019;t know then what that was, but whatever it was, I knew it wasn&#x2019;t good. The taunt stayed with me. It was thrown at me in many other guises, and eventually I blamed my father.</p><p>I always felt different growing up. My family was an anomaly in rural Maine&#x2014;a clan of outsiders. There was my unfamiliar, unpronounceable last name: von Hoyningen-Huene. Even just von Huene was bad enough; I longed to be Linda or Susan, Smith, Jones, or Brown. There was the language, and there was the taint of being German. And in spite of my mother&#x2019;s tireless efforts to always provide a beautiful place to come home to, my sense of dislocation never budged. There was nowhere that felt unmistakably like &#x201c;home.&#x201d;</p><p>My father&#x2019;s parents, Baltic Germans exiled from Saint Petersburg to<br>Germany after the Bolshevik Revolution, had suffered exile bitterly, feeling displaced, lost, and alien&#x2014;an awareness that also left an indelible mark on my father&#x2019;s life. His younger sister once told me that the only place she ever felt homesick for was Saint Petersburg, a city she had last seen as a twelve-year-old, more than seventy-five years before. Such feelings and memories were endemic; they came with the territory, demanding the lion&#x2019;s share of space in the exile&#x2019;s little bundle of belongings. Maybe for us, as for so many, they ran in the family.</p><p>My persistent hunt for home began long before my mother gave me<br>the Moroccan box, and much of it circled around my father. He had always been a presence, if iconic, and I was hardly ignorant about him. His portrait hung in our living room along with one of my parents as a young couple in Paris in 1929, by a celebrated photographer cousin, George Hoyningen-Huene. Assorted forebears kept them company on the walls. I knew about his past; stories about him were family lore. There were letters, diaries, and poems from his turbulent early years. I had read his letters from France as an officer in Hitler&#x2019;s army, where an occasional passage sounding alarmingly like Nazi propaganda had made me squirm, yet his awareness of history, his wide learning, his sympathy for people, and his enviable optimism shone from every page. His brief diary from the Russian front had also made me question what his being in Hitler&#x2019;s army really meant. Still, for me, he remained buried in the uneasy murk of history.</p><p>I had read about the backdrop to his life in his father&#x2019;s elegiac memoir. Spinning a magical lost world, it detailed life in tsarist Russia&#x2014;a civilization that disappeared like Brigadoon beneath the Bolshevik mists. Typed by my father&#x2019;s younger sister, with annotations and a genealogy, it had been privately printed and distributed to all far-flung family households. Along with memoirs by other ancestors, aunts and uncles, and many letters, it was part of a jumble of suggestive ephemera: portraits; poems; a small double-headed imperial Russian eagle in diamonds, once part of a tsarist medal presented to some forebear. Individually, these items all spoke, offering pieces of a puzzle, spurring my imagination, but providing little narrative. Together, they acted as a mute chorus, nudging me to become their amanuensis. It occurred to me that putting the pieces together might help me find where home lay.<br><br>My mother died about ten years after she gave me the box of letters, and not long after, turning the key opened it. Inexplicable, I thought, magical, until my husband confessed that he had tinkered with the lock.</p><p>After all these years, my father revealed himself quickly. Always dating his letters, numbering pages, he sometimes noted the day of the week, even the time of day. He had been a trained historian after all, yet this was not mere record-keeping; he was also truly sharing his days. His was an ordered mind and a giving nature. The voice of my mother&#x2019;s young lover, so long silent, emerged from his letters like a genie out of a bottle. From the pages of one letter slipped silken, nearly transparent poppy petals of the palest salmon pink&#x2014;the tender gesture of a long-ago love.</p><p>So this was the person who had lurked inside the box all those years: no bland Hartford, Connecticut, swain, no dull future captain of an insurance empire. Small wonder my mother was boulevers�e when they met in France; more than seven decades later, he was charming me. His habit of enclosing flowers in letters was one she later adopted, but here, though she would have foreseen my eventual intrusion, I still felt I was prying. A flurry of envelopes, addressed to Hartford in June, July, and August of 1928, was meticulously dated in my mother&#x2019;s hand; this batch was clearly important. My mother was ushering me into their young love.</p><p>I began to read. As I came to grips with his loose, generous hand, the father I had never known came spectacularly, breathtakingly alive. Finding sleep after such an introduction was nearly impossible. In the dark, I grappled with this vivid interloper I had known only as a kind of household god. His letters destroyed that status completely, shifting the emotional landscape I had established over a lifetime as the child of a single parent. This was the other side of the parental equation. It changed everything, demanding a revision of my views of my mother and a rearrangement of the family constellation.</p><p>One letter stood out. Postmarked London, February 11, 1928, it was addressed to my mother in Paris. Their young romance is blossoming quickly. If she will meet him,</p><p><br>. . . your great wish will be fulfilled: You shall put on your best clothes . . . and we shall go and do something grand and brilliant. Do you insist on my wearing full dress? Won&#x2019;t this be an historic night: Miss Mayflower flirting with the &#x201c;Hun.&#x201d;</p><p>Apart from shattering his remoteness completely, the letter put its finger squarely on my own puzzling provenance. Clearly the man who had left me his name and his profile was no clich� Hun at all, no bellicose militarist with monocle and bristling moustache, not even absolutely German&#x2014;as his Russian diary attested. Young, lively, fully aware of the label history had affixed to him, and with an acute sense of humor, he was demolishing all my preconceived notions. The Miss Mayflower he was referring to in impeccable English, though of Mayflower stock, was obviously not my worn, hard-pressed, ever-practical mother, but a carefree spirit, wanting, as she had written him, &#x201c;to put on my best clothes and go on a bat with you,&#x201d; adding, &#x201c;It must be most romantic to have a young and ravishing female creature, head-over-heels in love and following you all over Europe.&#x201d;<br><br>The pieces on my mother&#x2019;s side of the puzzle were varied too, if less exotic. An American cousin spent many hours interviewing my mother, meticulously transcribing the result; another put together a comprehensive genealogy. Late in her long life when she woke early, my mother often spent those mornings writing recollections on a pad propped against her knees in bed. After she left Maine for Arizona, I tried to make sense of her scrappy, loose-leaf pages, but with a continent between us, distance, my own reticence, and life intervened, leaving me with regrets that I know many share. I asked questions&#x2014;never enough questions, and never the right ones. The confessional mode was terra incognita in our family, and my mother had a talent for closing doors on what was over. I was reluctant to pry those doors open, no matter the cost.</p><p>Apart from those to an American friend, Mary, few of my mother&#x2019;s letters survived. But these&#x2014;written between 1928 and 1947&#x2014;are a record of extraordinary times. Had I not found them cached in a rusty file cabinet as I helped clean out Mary&#x2019;s apartment after her death, this window onto my mother&#x2019;s evolution from breathless fianc�e to expatriate wife and mother, observing Germany&#x2019;s 1930s and &#x2019;40s, would never have opened for me. The carefree, playful young thing I encountered in the early missives was unrecognizable as the mother I knew. Her letters added to the clamor of voices driving this book forward, pushing the story further, if not anywhere near its end. Without them, there might never have been a book, just fragments without a narrative, no story at all.<br><br>Who were these people? What had brought such an unlikely pair together? And where did their eventual alliance leave me? Accidents of history had joined them, and the entangled mysteries of love, sex, and money. How they had shaped me was yet to be determined, but where should the story of two lives whose strands ran separately far longer than they had been knitted together begin? And how should otherblives&#x2014;those of the parents, aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, and<br>grandparents&#x2014;be woven into the fabric? Tangents, vagaries, shifts, and turns are uncomfortable in the tyranny of chronology, yet history is tyranny too, and the convulsive history of the century that shaped my parents&#x2019; lives refused to obey any other imperative.</p><p>&#x201c;One lives so many different lives,&#x201d; my mother used to say. &#x201c;Life is<br>a verb. Everyone has a story.&#x201d;</p><p>This book is theirs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>1<br><br>Mademoiselle Sophie&#x2019;s Hat</b></p><p><br>The world was more or less whole in 1927, still healing from World War I, but on the mend. Aim�e Ellis and an old school friend, an actress named Hope Cary, began their trip in Sicily, and then planned to follow spring up the Italian boot. Easter week found them among Palermo&#x2019;s dim churches and golden mosaics. All Sicily was in bloom. At Agrigento they traipsed through flowering meadows to picnic in the great temple&#x2019;s shadow. They lolled on deserted beaches looking out toward Africa. On Aim�e&#x2019;s nickel they spent a few days at a splendid old grande dame of a hotel bellied up against the amphitheater in Taormina, the windows of their baroque room looking out on Mount Etna, smoldering in the distance. They sashayed around Capri, sauntered through Rome, then on to Florence and the hill towns of Assisi and Orvieto. The world seemed miraculously beautiful.</p><p>All along the way, Hope kept saying that she&#x2019;d met a Russian in Providence, Rhode Island, who was studying at the Sorbonne now. Aim�e must meet him when they got to Paris. She imagined Hope&#x2019;s Russian in his late thirties, compact, dark, and intense. Instead he was twenty-three, tall, and handsome as a young god.</p><p>Baron Heinrich Alexis Nikolai von Hoyningen-Huene was in fact only somewhat Russian. His family was Baltic German aristocracy, a particular caste whose lives had always gravitated toward the tsarist court, and who divided their time between Saint Petersburg and their estates in the Baltic countries. In flawless English, he explained that Germans, many of them like his family, descendants of the crusading Teutonic knights, had been settled in the Baltics since the thirteenth century. After Peter the Great crushed Swedish supremacy in the region, he encouraged more Germans to immigrate, promising them an independent administration with German language and laws. The Baltic nobility profited enormously and played a significant part in the imperial Russian civil and military services ever after. At one point, Heinfamily was one of the largest landowners in the Baltics.</p><p>In the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg, Baltic Germans established German churches, schools, and cultural institutions. The fight against Napoleon&#x2014;many of Heinrich&#x2019;s ancestors had fought for Russia&#x2014;only reinforced their influence. But when Tsar Alexander III ascended the throne in 1881, his fervent Russian patriotism and anti-German stance rattled their privilege and independence. Despite reforms, the revolutionary unrest of 1905 only foreshadowed 1917, when the Bolsheviks seized power and many Baltic Germans went into exile.</p><p>The riddle of how Heinrich came to meet Hope in Providence, Rhode Island, was explained by an entertaining story about Mlle. Sophie, a longtime governess in Heinrich&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s family. In the semidarkness of a train compartment en route to Vienna, a young American gentleman accidentally sat on Mlle. Sophie&#x2019;s hat. Her lighthearted reaction to his gaffe charmed the embarrassed Mr. Alfred Lorand-Lustig, and for the rest of their journey the two young people talked animatedly. In Vienna, Alfred introduced Sophie to his mother and sister; several weeks later, she and Alfred were engaged. Having stayed in touch with the Hoyningen-Huenes, she was aware that revolution had left the family refugees, without home, lands, or money. In 1924, as Mrs. Lorand-Lustig, she wrote to suggest that Heinrich&#x2019;s extraordinary language abilities could earn him American dollars as representative to the new foreign operations of the Nicholson File Company in Providence, where her well-to-do husband held an im...</p></p><h2>Corum - The King of Swords: The Eternal Champion</h2><p>The old races have perished.

Barbie stars as Clara, of course dolled up in pink flounces and lace, and coifed within an inch of her blonde Malibu life. Hoffman's holiday tale is almost unrecognizable, with Clara/Barbie and the Nutcracker setting off on a quest to reverse a shrinking spell cast by the Mouse King. Along the way they meet such creatures as Major Mint, Colonel Candy and Marzipan (a purple horse with Barbie-like tresses). When Clara/Barbie's new friends are kidnapped by the Mouse King, she rescues them in one anticlimactic sentence ("When Clara reached the castle, she sneaked inside and saved her friends"). The chirpy text depends as heavily on exclamation marks to generate excitement as Sauber's overwrought illustrations do on shades of pink and purple. Given the merchandising power behind the star, this saccharine performance may be the only exposure many children will have to a tale whose timeless magic deserves better.

It was noon. He shuffled forward, fighting gravity and exhaustion, his will keeping him upright and moving. His mouth was full of the rusty taste of old fear; his stomach had given up complaining about the absence of food days ago. His hands wrapped around the leather reins, using them to lead Promise ever forward. They were a lifeline, helping him to keep standing, keep walking. <br>Promise was in bad shape. A hard tumble down one of the dunes in the 40-Mile Desert was forcing her to keep weight off her left hind leg. She was staggering along as best she could, just like Jim. He hadn&#x2019;t ridden her since the fall yesterday, but he knew that if he didn&#x2019;t try to get up on her and get moving, they were both as good as buzzard food soon. At their present pace, they still had a good three or four days of traveling through this wasteland before they would reach Virginia City and the mythical job with the railroad. <br>Right now, he didn&#x2019;t care that he had no money in his pockets. He didn&#x2019;t care that he only had a few tepid swallows of water left in his canteen or that if he managed to make it to Virginia City he might be recognized from a wanted poster and sent back to Albright for a proper hanging. Right now, all he was worried about was saving his horse, the brown mustang that had been his companion since he was a child. <br>Promise snorted dust out of her dark nostrils. She shook her head and slowed. <br>&#x201c;Come on, girl,&#x201d; he croaked through a throat that felt like it was filled with broken shale. &#x201c;Just a little ways longer. Come on.&#x201d; <br>The mare reluctantly heeded Jim&#x2019;s insistent tugging on the reins and lurched forward again. Jim rubbed her neck. <br>&#x201c;Good girl, Promise. Good girl.&#x201d; <br>The horse&#x2019;s eyes were wide with crazy fear, but she listened to Jim&#x2019;s voice and trusted in it. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get us out of here, girl. I swear I will.&#x201d; But he knew that was a lie. He was as frightened as Promise. He was fifteen years old and he was going to die out here, thousands of miles from his home and family. <br>They continued on, heading west, always west. Jim knew far ahead of them lay the Carson River, but it might as well be on the moon. They were following the ruts of old wagon train paths, years old. If they had more water and some shelter, they might make it, but they didn&#x2019;t. The brackish salt ponds they passed spoke to the infernal nature of this place. For days now, they had stumbled over the bleached bones of horses, and worse. Other lost souls, consigned to the waste of the 40-Mile. <br>During the seemingly endless walk, Jim had found artifacts, partially eaten by the sand and clay&#x2014;the cracked porcelain face of a little girl&#x2019;s doll. It made him think of Lottie. She&#x2019;d be seven now. A broken pocket watch held a sun-faded photograph of a stern-looking man dressed in a Union uniform. It reminded him of Pa. Jim wondered if some unfortunate wandering this path in the future would find a token of his and Promise&#x2019;s passing, the only record of his exodus through this godforsaken land, the only proof that he had ever existed at all. <br>He fished the eye out of his trouser pocket and examined it in the unforgiving sunlight. It was a perfect orb of milky glass. Inlaid in the orb was a dark circle and, within it, a perfect ring of frosted jade. At the center of the jade ring was an oval of night. When the light struck the jade at just the right angle, tiny unreadable characters could be seen engraved in the stone. It was his father&#x2019;s eye, and it was the reason for the beginning and the end of his journey. He put it back in a handkerchief and stuffed it in his pocket, filled with an angry desire to deny it to the desert. He pressed onward and Promise reluctantly followed. <br>He had long ago lost track of concepts like time. Days were starting to bleed into one another as the buzzing in his head, like angry hornets, grew stronger and more insistent with each passing step. But he knew the sun was more before him now than behind him. He stopped again. When had he stopped to look at the eye? Minutes ago, years? The wagon trails, fossilized and twisting through the baked landscape, had brought him to a crossroads in the wasteland. Two rutted paths crossed near a pile of skulls. Most of the skulls belonged to cattle and coyotes, but the number that belonged to animals of the two-legged variety unnerved Jim. Atop the pile was a piece of slate, a child&#x2019;s broken and discarded chalkboard, faded by sand, salt and sun. On it, in red paint, written in a crude, looping scrawl were the words: <i>Golgotha: 18 mi. Redemption: 32 mi. Salvation: 50 mi.</i> <br>During Jim&#x2019;s few furtive days in Panacea, after crossing over from Utah, he had been surprised by the number of Mormons in Nevada and how much influence they had already accumulated in this young state. There were numerous small towns and outposts dotting the landscape with the most peculiar religious names, marking the Mormon emigration west. He had never heard of any of these towns, but if there were people there would be fresh water and shelter from the sun. <br>&#x201c;See, Promise, only eighteen more miles to go and we&#x2019;re home free, girl.&#x201d; He pulled the reins, and they were off again. He didn&#x2019;t much care for staying in a place named Golgotha, but he was more than willing to visit a spell. <br>The trail continued, the distance measured by the increasing ache in Jim&#x2019;s dried-out muscles, the growing hum in his head that was obscuring thought. The sun was retreating behind distant, shadowy hills. The relief from the sun was a fleeting victory. Already a chill was settling over his red, swollen skin as the desert&#x2019;s temperature began to plunge. Promise shivered too and snorted in discomfort. There was only so much farther she could go without rest. He knew it would be better to travel at night and take advantage of the reprieve from the sun, but he was simply too tired and too cold to go on, and he feared wandering off the wagon trail in the darkness and becoming lost. <br>He was looking for a place to hole up for the night when Promise suddenly gave a violent whinny and reared up on her hind legs. Jim, still holding the reins, felt himself jerked violently off the ground. Promise&#x2019;s injured hind leg gave way and both boy and horse tumbled down a rocky shelf off to the left of the rutted path. There was confusion, and falling and then a sudden, brutal stop. Jim was prone with his back against Promise&#x2019;s flank. After a few feeble attempts to rise, the horse whimpered and stopped trying. <br>Jim stood, beating the dust off his clothes. Other than a wicked burn on his wrist where the leather reins had torn away the skin, he was unharmed. The small gully they were in had walls of crumbling clay and was sparsely dotted with sickly sage plants. Jim knelt near Promise&#x2019;s head and stroked the shaking mare. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, girl. We both need a rest. You just close your eyes, now. I&#x2019;ve got you. You&#x2019;re safe with me.&#x201d; <br>A coyote howled in the distance, and his brethren picked up the cry. The sky was darkening from indigo to black. Jim fumbled in his saddlebags and removed Pa&#x2019;s pistol, the one he had used in the war. He checked the cylinder of the .44 Colt and snapped the breech closed, satisfied that it was ready to fire. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, girl; ain&#x2019;t nobody gitting you tonight. I promised you I&#x2019;d get us out of here, and I&#x2019;m going to keep my word. A man ain&#x2019;t no good for nothing if he don&#x2019;t keep his word.&#x201d; <br>Jim slid the coarse army blanket and bedroll off the saddle. He draped the blanket over Promise as best he could, and wrapped himself in the thin bedding. The wind picked up a few feet above their heads, whistling and shrieking. A river of swirling dust flowed over them, carried by the terrible sound. When he had been a boy, Jim had been afraid of the wind moaning, like a restless haint, around the rafters where his bed was nestled. Even though he knew he was a man now and men didn&#x2019;t cotton to such fears, this place made him feel small and alone. <br>After an hour, he checked Promise&#x2019;s leg. It was bad, but not so bad yet that it couldn&#x2019;t heal. He wished he had a warm stable and some oats and water to give her, a clean brush for her hide. He&#x2019;d settle for the water, though. She was strong, her heart was strong, but it had been days since she had taken in water. Strength and heart only went so far in the desert. From her labored breathing, that wasn&#x2019;t going to be enough to reach Golgotha. <br>The frost settled into his bones sometime in the endless night. Even fear and the cold weren&#x2019;t enough to keep him anchored to this world. He slipped into the warm, narcotic arms of sleep. <br>His eyes snapped open. The coyote was less than three feet from his face. Its breath swirled, a mask of silver mist in the space between them. Its eyes were embers in a fireplace. There was intelligence behind the red eyes, worming itself into Jim&#x2019;s innards. In his mind, he heard chanting, drums. He saw himself as a rabbit&#x2014;weak, scared, prey. <br>Jim remembered the gun. His frozen fingers fumbled numbly for it on the ground. <br>The coyote narrowed its gaze and showed yellowed teeth. Some were crooked, snagged, but the canines were sharp and straight. <br> <i>You think you can kill me with slow, spiritless lead, little rabbit?</i> Its eyes spoke to Jim. <i>I am the fire giver, the trickster spirit. I am faster than Old Man Rattler, quieter than the Moon Woman&#x2019;s light. See, go on, see! Shoot me with your dead, empty gun.</i> <br>Jim glanced down at the gun, slid his palm around the butt and brought it up quickly. The coyote was gone; only the fog of its breath remained. Jim heard the coyote yipping in the distance. It sounded like laughter at his expense. <br>His eyes drooped, and closed. <br>He awoke with a start. It was still dark, but dawn was a threat on the horizon. The gun was in his hand. He saw the coyote&#x2019;s tracks and wondered again if perhaps he had already died out here and was now wandering Hell&#x2019;s foyer, being taunted by demon dogs and cursed with eternal thirst as penance for the crimes he had committed back home. <br>Promise stirred, fitfully, made a few pitiful sounds and then was still. Jim rested his head on her side. Her heart still beat; her lungs struggled to draw air. <br>If he was in Hell, he deserved it, alone. He stroked her mane and waited for the Devil to rise up, bloated and scarlet in the east. He dozed again. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>He remembered how strong his father&#x2019;s hands were, but how soft his voice was too. Pa seldom shouted &#x2019;less he had been drinking on account of the headaches. <br>It was a cold West Virginia spring. The frost still clung to the delicate, blooming blue sailors and the cemetery plants early in the morning, but, by noon, the sky was clear and bright and the blustery wind blowing through the mountains was more warm than chill. <br>Pa and Jim were mending some of Old Man Wimmer&#x2019;s fences alongside their own property. Pa had done odd jobs for folk all over Preston County since he had come back from the war. He had even helped build onto the Cheat River Saloon over in Albright, the closest town to the Negrey homestead. <br>Lottie had brought a lunch pail over to them: corn muffins, a little butter and some apples as well as a bucket of fresh water. Lottie was five then, and her hair was the same straw color as Jim&#x2019;s, only lighter, more golden in the sunlight. It fell almost to her waist, and Momma brushed it with her fine silver combs in the firelight at night before bedtime. The memory made Jim&#x2019;s heart ache. It was what he thought of whenever he thought of home. <br>&#x201c;Is it good, Daddy?&#x201d; Lottie asked Pa. He was leaning against the fence post, eagerly finishing off his apple. <br>&#x201c;M&#x2019;hm.&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;Tell your ma, these doings are a powerful sight better than those sheet-iron crackers and skillygallee old General Pope used to feed us, darling.&#x201d; <br>Jim took a long, cool draw off the water ladle and looked at Pa, sitting there, laughing with Lottie. Jim thought he would never be able to be as tall or proud or heroic as Billy Negrey was to him. The day Pa had returned from the war, when President Lincoln said it was over and all the soldiers could go home, was the happiest day of Jim&#x2019;s young life. Even though Pa came back thin, and Momma fussed over him to eat more, and even though he had the eye patch and the headaches that came with it, that only made him seem more mysterious, more powerful, to Jim. <br>Lottie watched her father&#x2019;s face intently while he finished off the apple, nibbling all around the core <br>&#x201c;Was it Gen&#x2019;ral Pope that took away your eye?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Pa laughed. &#x201c;I reckon in a matter of speaking he did, my girl. Your old daddy didn&#x2019;t duck fast enough, and he took a bullet right in the eye. Don&#x2019;t complain, though. Other boys, they got it hundred times worse.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pa, why does Mr. Campbell in town say you got a Chinaman&#x2019;s eye?&#x201d; Jim asked with a sheepish smile. <br>&#x201c;Now, James Matherson Negrey, you know good and well why.&#x201d; He looked from one eager face to the other and shook his head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you two ever get tired of hearing this story?&#x201d; <br>They both shook their heads, and Billy laughed again. <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay. When I was serving with General Pope, my unit&#x2014;the First Infantry out of West Virginia&#x2014;we were in the middle of this big ol&#x2019; fight, y&#x2019;see&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bull Run? Right, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. He already knew the answer, and Billy knew he knew. <br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; Billy said. &#x201c;Second scrap we had on the same piece of land. Anyways, old General Pope, he made some pretty bad calculations and&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How bad, Pa?&#x201d; Lottie asked. <br>&#x201c;Darling, we were getting catawamptiously chawed up.&#x201d; <br>The children laughed, like they always did. <br>Billy continued. &#x201c;So the call comes for us to fall back, and that was when I&nbsp;&#x2026; when I got a Gardner right square in the eye. I was turning my head to see if old Luther Potts was falling back when it hit me. Turning my head probably saved my life.&#x201d; <br>Billy rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. <br>&#x201c;You all right, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. <br>&#x201c;Fine, Jim. Fetch me some water, will you? So, Lottie, where was I?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got shot in the eye.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Right. So I don&#x2019;t recall much specific after that. I was in a lot of pain. I heard&nbsp;&#x2026; well, I could hear some of what was going on all around me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like what, Pa?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Never you mind. Anyways, someone grabbed me up, and dragged me for a spell, and finally I heard the sawbones telling someone to hold me still, and they did and I went to sleep for a long time. I dreamed about you and Jim and your mother. The stuff they give you to sleep makes you have funny dreams. I remember seeing someone all dressed up fancy in green silk, some kind of old man, but his hair was long like a woman&#x2019;s, and he was jawing at me, but I couldn&#x2019;t understand him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When did you wake up, Pa?&#x201d; Jim asked. Even though he knew the story by heart, he always tried to flesh it out with any new details that he could glean from the retelling. <br>&#x201c;Few days later in a hospital tent. My head hurt bad and it was kind of hard to think or hear.&#x201d; Billy paused and seemed to wince. Jim handed him the wooden ladle full of cool water. He gulped it down and blinked a few times with his good eye. &#x201c;They told me we had fallen back and were on our way to Washington for garrison duty. General Pope was in a powerful lot of trouble too. <br>&#x201c;They told me I had lost the eye, but was mighty lucky to be alive. I didn&#x2019;t feel too lucky right that minute, but compared to all the lads who didn&#x2019;t come home at all, I figure I did have an angel on my shoulder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So tell us about the Chinaman, Pa!&#x201d; Lottie practically squealed. <br>Billy winced but went on, with a for...</p><h2>The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth</h2><p>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today's</em> 1996 Books of the Year! In recent years Jesus' time, place and social setting have received renewed scholarly attention. New research on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other Jewish and Hellenistic texts has resulted in a surge of new images of Jesus and new ideas about his ministry. Dubbed the Third Quest for the historical Jesus, this recent effort is a transformation of the first quest, memorialized and chronicled by Albert Schweitzer, and the second quest, carried out in the 1950s and 1960s in the wake of extreme Bultmannian skepticism. The controversial works of John Dominic Crossan, Marcus Borg and Burton Mack, and the results of the Jesus Seminar have been thrust upon the public by publicists and media as the voices of learned consensus. Meanwhile, at the center of the scholarly investigation of Jesus, a less celebrated but certainly no less informed majority rejects many of the methods and conclusions of those who have captured the limelight. In <em>The Jesus Quest</em> Ben Witherington, a participant in the Quest, offers the first comprehensive determination and assessment of what scholars are really saying about Jesus. In addition to the views of Crossan, Borg and Mack, he presents and interacts with the work of important scholars such as Geza Vermes, E. P. Sanders, Gerd Theissen, Richard Horsley, John P. Meier, N. T. Wright and Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, as well as outlining his own understanding of Jesus as sage. Here is an indispensable survey and assessment of the most significant religious scholarly debate of the 1990s. Now with a lengthy new postscript, the new paperback edition of this widely praised book updates you on the continuing saga of the Third Quest for the historical Jesus.</p><p>Now with a lengthy new postscript, this widely praised book updates you on the continuing saga of the Third Quest for the historical Jesus.Ben Witherington III (PhD, University of Durham) is Jean R.

Originating from the &#39;Norsemen&#39; they were one of the most successful warrior tribes of the Dark Ages that came to dominate Europe from the Baltic Sea to the island of Sicily and the borders of Eastern Europe. Beginning as Viking raiders in the eighth century, the Normans not only changed the landscape of Europe but were changed by their new conquests. As a military force they became unstoppable; as conquerors, they established their own kingdom in Normandy from where they set out on a number of devastating campaigns, where they also introduced innovations in politics, architecture and culture. In A Brief History of the Normans, leading French historian, Francois Neveux, gives an accessible and authoritative introduction.</p><p>Francois Neveux is the leading medieval historian in France and has written numerous books on the Normans.

For each volume, a series editor reads pieces from hundreds of periodicals, then selects between fifty and a hundred outstanding works. That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.<br><br>This year's Best American Short Stories features a rich mix of voices, from both intriguing new writers and established masters of the form like Michael Chabon, Edwidge Danticat, Richard Ford, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Arthur Miller. The 2002 collection includes stories about everything from illicit love affairs to family, the immigrant experience and badly behaved children -- stories varied in subject but unified in their power and humanity. In the words of this year's guest editor, the best-selling author Sue Miller, "The American short story today [is] healthy and strong . . . These stories arrived in the nick of time . . . to teach me once more what we read fiction for."</p><p>In her opening remarks to <i>The Best American Short Stories 2002</i>, guest editor Sue Miller notes the difficulty of reading fiction produced during 2001, the year of the September 11 terrorist attacks. She also remarks that by the time she had finalized her 20 selections, this act of reading had restored her faith both in fiction's significance and its ability to tap into timeless themes. The 2002 anthology includes stories best described as realist fiction or traditional fiction, many set in contemporary times. The tales range from E.L. Doctorow's "A House on the Plains," a murder set at the turn of the century, to pieces with more recent settings, like "Puppy" by Richard Ford, which shows how a New Orleans couple deals--or doesn't deal--with the appearance of a stray dog. Both Jhumpa Lahiri's "Nobody's Business" and Edwidge Danticat's "Seven" deftly portray the disconnection a semi-assimilated Indian American and Haitian American couple experience both as partners and as U.S. citizens. Leonard Michael's "Nachman from Los Angeles," in contrast, adds some levity to the mix. Miller adds in her preface that maybe next year the tales will depart further from tradition, but judging from this volume no departure is necessary: the selections take the reader on a delightful journey through some of America's best contemporary writers. <i>--Jane Hodges</i>Sue Miller is the best-selling author of <i>The Good Mother</i> (also a feature film), <i>Interviewing the Abbotts</i> (also a feature film),<i> Family Pictures </i>(nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award), <i>For Love, The Distinguished Guest, While I Was Gone </i>(an Oprah pick), and <i>The World Below.</i></p><h2>Little match girl (sandcastle)</h2><p>The wares of the poor little match girl illuminate her cold world, bringing some beauty to her brief, tragic life.</p><p><p>Rachel Isadora began dancing at the age of eight.

Robert Jordan, a young American volunteer, has been sent to handle the dynamiting. There, in the mountains, he finds the dangers and the intense comradeship of war. And there he discovers Maria, a young woman who has escaped from Franco&#39;s rebels...</p><p><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert attached to the International Brigades, lies "flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees." The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: "I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out." For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. <blockquote> "I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted. If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us. If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go. I am tired of all this. You hear?" He turned to Robert Jordan. "What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?" </blockquote> In one short chapter Hemingway lays out the blueprint for what is to come: Jordan's sense of duty versus Pablo's dangerous self-interest and weariness with the war. Complicating matters even more are two members of the guerrilla leader's small band: his "woman" Pilar, and Maria, a young woman whom Pablo rescued from a Republican prison train. Unlike her man, Pilar is still fiercely devoted to the cause and as Pablo's loyalty wanes, she becomes the moral center of the group. Soon Jordan finds himself caught between the two, even as his own resolve is tested by his growing feelings for Maria. <p> <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> combines two of the author's recurring obsessions: war and personal honor. The pivotal battle scene involving El Sordo's last stand is a showcase for Hemingway's narrative powers, but the quieter, ongoing conflict within Robert Jordan as he struggles to fulfill his mission perhaps at the cost of his own life is a testament to his creator's psychological acuity. By turns brutal and compassionate, it is arguably Hemingway's most mature work and one of the best war novels of the 20th century. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Too Perfect: When Being In Control Gets Out Of Control</h2><p>Identifies the personality traits of an overachiever--the dread of making mistakes, the tendency to criticize, difficulty in making decisions or commitments--to help perfectionists modify their behavior. 50,000 first printing. $30,000 ad/promo.

The air was hot and moist; birds were singing in the trees. On her hands and knees, she stabbed the dirt, chopping it loose. One handful at a time, she scooped it away. Some of the weakness had abated but not all. Her body felt loose, disorganized, drained. There was pain, and the memory of pain. Three days had passed, or was it four? Perspiration beaded on her face; she licked her lips to taste the salt. She dug and dug. The sweat ran in rivulets, falling into the earth. That&#x2019;s where everything goes, Alicia thought, in the end. Everything goes into the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pile beside her swelled. How deep was enough? Three feet down, the soil began to change. It became colder, with the odor of clay. It seemed like a sign. She rocked back on her boots and took a long drink from her canteen. Her hands were raw; the flesh at the base of her thumb had peeled back in a sheet. She placed the web of her hand to her mouth and used her teeth to sever the flap of skin and spat it into the dirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soldier was waiting for her at the edge of the clearing, his jaws loudly working on a stand of waist--high grass. The grace of his haunches, his rich mane and blue roan coat, the magnificence of his hooves and teeth and the great black marbles of his eyes: an aura of splendor surrounded him. He possessed, when he chose, an absolute calm, then, in the next moment, could perform remarkable deeds. His wise face lifted at the sound of her approach. <i>I see. We&#x2019;re ready.</i> He turned in a slow arc, his neck bent low, and followed her into the trees to the place where she had pitched her tarp. On the ground beside Alicia&#x2019;s bloody bedroll lay the small bundle, swaddled in a stained blanket. Her daughter had lived less than an hour, yet in that hour Alicia had become a mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soldier watched as she emerged. The baby&#x2019;s face was covered; Alicia drew back the cloth. Soldier bent his face to the child&#x2019;s, his nostrils flaring, breathing in her scent. Tiny nose and eyes and rosebud mouth, startling in their humanness; her head was covered in a cap of soft red hair. But there was no life, no breath. Alicia had wondered if she would be capable of loving her&#x2014;-this child conceived in terror and pain, fathered by a monster. A man who had beaten her, raped her, cursed her. How foolish she&#x2019;d been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to the clearing. The sun was directly overhead; insects buzzed in the grass, a rhythmic pulsing. Soldier stood beside her as she laid her daughter in the grave. When her labor had started, Alicia had begun to pray. <i>Let her be all right.</i> As the hours of agony dissolved into one another, she had felt death&#x2019;s cold presence inside her. The pain pounded through her, a wind of steel; it echoed in her cells like thunder. Something was wrong. <i>Please, God, protect her, protect us.</i> But her prayers had fallen into the void.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first handful of soil was the hardest. How did one do it? Alicia had buried many men. Some she&#x2019;d known, and some she hadn&#x2019;t; only one she&#x2019;d loved. The boy, Hightop. So funny, so alive, then gone. She let the dirt sift through her fingers. It struck the cloth with a pattering sound, like the first spits of rain upon leaves. Bit by bit her daughter disappeared. <i>Goodbye,</i> she thought, <i>goodbye, my darling, my one.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to her tent. Her soul felt shattered, like a million chips of glass inside her. Her bones were tubes of lead. She needed water, food; her stores were exhausted. But hunting was out of the question, and the creek, a five--minute walk down the hillside, felt like miles away. The needs of the body: what did they matter? Nothing mattered. She lay on her bedroll and closed her eyes, and soon she was asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She dreamed of a river. A wide, dark river, and above it the moon was shining. It laid its light across the water like a golden road. What lay ahead Alicia did not know, only that she needed to cross this river. She took her first cautious step upon its glowing surface. Her mind felt divided: half marveled at this unlikely mode of travel; the other half did not. As the moon touched the far shore, she realized she had been deceived. The shining pathway was dissolving. She broke into a run, desperate to reach the other side before the river swallowed her. But the distance was too great; with every step she took, the horizon leapt farther away. The water sloshed around her ankles, her knees, her waist. She had no strength to fight its pull. <i>Come to me, Alicia. Come to me, come to me, come to me.</i> She was sinking, the river was taking her, she was plunging into darkness&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She awoke to a muted orange light; the day had nearly passed. She lay motionless, assembling her thoughts. She had grown accustomed to these nightmares; the pieces changed but never the feeling of them&#x2014;-the futility, the fear. Yet this time something was different. An aspect of the dream had traveled into life; her shirt was sopping. She looked down to see the widening stains. Her milk had come in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>* </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Staying was not a conscious decision; the will to move on was simply absent. Her strength returned. It approached with small steps; then, like a guest long awaited, it arrived all at once. She constructed a shelter of deadfall and vines, using the tarp as a roof. The woods abounded with life: squirrels and rabbits, quail and doves, deer. Some were too quick for her but not all. She set traps and waited to collect her kill or took them on her cross: one shot, a clean death, then dinner, raw and warm. At the end of each day when the light had faded, she bathed in the creek. The water was clear and shockingly cold. It was on such an excursion that she saw the bears. A rustling ten yards upstream, something heavy moving in the brush; then they appeared at the edge of the creek, a mother and a pair of cubs. Alicia had never seen such creatures in the flesh, only in books. They prowled the shallows together, pushing the mud with their snouts. There was something loose and half--formed about their anatomy, as if the muscles were not firmly stitched to the skin beneath their heavy, twig--tangled coats. A cloud of insects sparkled around them, catching the last of the light. But the bears did not appear to notice her or, if they did, did not think she was important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The summer faded. One day, a world of fat green leaves, dense with shadow; then the woods exploded with riotous color. In the morning, the floor of the forest crunched with frost. Winter&#x2019;s cold descended with a feeling of purity. Snow lay heavy on the land. The black lines of the trees, the small footprints of birds, the whitewashed sky, bleached of all tone: everything had been pared to its essence. What month was it? What day? As time wore on, food became a problem. For hours, whole days even, she barely moved, conserving her strength; she hadn&#x2019;t spoken to a living soul in nearly a year. Gradually it came to her that she was no longer thinking in words, as if she had become a creature of the forest. She wondered if she was losing her mind. She began to talk to Soldier, as if he were a person. <i>Soldier,</i> she would say, <i>what should we have for dinner? Soldier, do you think it&#x2019;s time to gather wood for the fire? Soldier, does the sky look like snow?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One night she awoke in the shelter and realized that for some time she&#x2019;d been hearing thunder. A wet spring wind was blowing in directionless gusts, hurling around in the treetops. With a feeling of detachment, Alicia listened to the storm&#x2019;s approach; then it was suddenly upon them. A blast of lightning forked the sky, freezing the scene in her eyes, followed by an earsplitting clap. She let Soldier inside as the heavens opened, ejecting raindrops heavy as bullets. The horse was shivering with terror. Alicia needed to calm him; just one panicked movement in the tiny space and his massive body would blow the shelter to pieces. <i>You&#x2019;re my good boy,</i> she murmured, stroking his flank. With her free hand she slipped the rope around his neck. <i>My good, good boy. What do you say? Keep a girl company on a rainy night?</i> His body was tense with fear, a wall of coiled muscle, and yet when she applied slow force to draw him downward, he allowed it. Beyond the walls of the shelter, the lightning flashed, the heavens rolled. He dropped to his knees with a mighty sigh, turned onto his side beside her bedroll, and that was how the two of them slept as the rain poured down all night, washing winter away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She abided in that place for two years. Leaving was not easy; the woods had become a solace. She had taken its rhythms as her own. But when Alicia&#x2019;s third summer began, a new feeling stirred: the time had come to move on. To finish what she&#x2019;d started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She passed the rest of the summer preparing. This involved the construction of a weapon. She left on foot for the river towns and returned three days later, hauling a clanking bag. She understood the basics of what she was attempting, having watched the process many times; the details would come through trial and error. A flat--topped boulder by the creek would serve as her anvil. At the water&#x2019;s edge, she stoked her fire and watched it burn down to coals. Maintaining the right temperature was the trick. When she felt she had it right, she removed the first piece from the sack: a bar of O1 steel, two inches wide, three feet long, three--eighths of an inch thick. From the sack she also withdrew a hammer, iron tongs, and thick leather gloves. She placed the end of the steel bar in the fire and watched its color change as the metal heated. Then she got to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took three more trips downriver for supplies, and the results were crude, but in the end she was satisfied. She used coarse, stringy vines to wrap the handle, giving her fist a solid purchase on the otherwise smooth metal. Its weight was pleasant in her grip. The polished tip shone in the sun. But the first cut would be the true test. On her final trip downriver, she had wandered upon a field of melons, the size of human heads. They grew in a dense patch, tangled with vines of grasping, hand--shaped leaves. She&#x2019;d selected one and carried it home in the sack. Now she balanced it atop a fallen log, took aim, and brought the sword down in a vertical arc. The severed halves rocked lazily away from each other, as if stunned, and flopped to the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing remained to hold her in place. The night before her departure, Alicia visited her daughter&#x2019;s grave. She did not want to do this at the last second; her exit should be clean. For two years the place had gone unmarked. Nothing had seemed worthy. But leaving it unacknowledged felt wrong. With the last of her steel, she&#x2019;d fashioned a cross. She used the hammer to tap it into the ground and knelt in the dirt. The body would be nothing now. Perhaps a few bones, or an impression of bones. Her daughter had passed into the soil, the trees, the rocks, even the sky and animals. She had gone into a place beyond knowing. Her untested voice was in the songs of birds, her cap of red hair in the flaming leaves of autumn. Alicia thought about these things, one hand touching the soft earth. But she had no more prayers inside her. The heart, once broken, stayed broken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Morning dawned unremarkably&#x2014;-windless, gray, the air compacted with mist. The sword, sheathed in a deer--hide scabbard, lay across her back at an angle; her blades, tucked in their bandoliers, were cinched in an X over her chest. Dark, gogglelike glasses, with leather shields at the temples, concealed her eyes. She fixed the saddlebag in place and swung onto Soldier&#x2019;s back. For days he&#x2019;d roamed restlessly, sensing their imminent departure. <i>Are we doing what I think we&#x2019;re doing? I rather like it here, you know.</i> Her plan was to ride east along the river, to follow its course through the mountains. With luck, she&#x2019;d reach New York before the first leaves fell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She closed her eyes, emptying her mind. Only when she had cleared this space would the voice emerge. It came from the same place dreams did, like wind from a cave, whispering into her ear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Alicia, you are not alone. I know your sorrow, because it&#x2019;s my own. I&#x2019;m waiting for you, Lish. Come to me. Come home.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She tapped Soldier&#x2019;s flanks with her heels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The day was just ending when Peter returned to the house. Above him, the immense Utah sky was breaking open in long fingers of color against the deepening blue. An evening in early autumn: the nights were cold, the days still fair. He made his way homeward along the murmuring river, his pole over his shoulder, the dog ambling at his side. In his bag were two fat trout, wrapped in golden leaves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he approached the farmstead, he heard music coming from the house. He removed his muddy boots on the porch, put down his bag, and eased inside. Amy was sitting at the old upright piano, her back facing the door. He moved in quietly behind her. So total was her concentration that she failed to notice his entry. He listened without moving, barely with breath. Amy&#x2019;s body was swaying slightly to the music. Her fingers moved nimbly up and down the keyboard, not so much playing the notes as calling them forth. The song was like a sonic embodiment of pure emotion. There was a deep heartache inside its phrases, but the feeling was expressed with such tenderness that it did not seem sad. It made him think of the way time felt, always falling into the past, becoming memory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re home.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The song had ended without his noticing. As he placed his hands on her shoulders, she shifted on the bench and tilted her face upward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He bent to receive her kiss. Her beauty was astonishing, a fresh discovery every time he looked at her. He tipped his head at the keys. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know how you do that,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you like it?&#x201d; She was smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been practicing all day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He told her he did; he loved it. It made him think of so many things, he said. It was hard to put into words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How was the river? You were gone a long while.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Was I?&#x201d; The day, like so many, had passed in a haze of contentment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so beautiful this time of year, I guess I just lost track.&#x201d; He kissed the top of her head. Her hair was freshly washed, smelling of the herbs she used to soften the harsh lye. &#x201c;Just play. I&#x2019;ll get dinner going.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He moved through the kitchen to the back door and into the yard. The garden was fading; soo...</p></p><h2>Liberty and Power: A Dialogue on Religion and U.S. Foreign Policy in an Unjust World (Pew Forum Dialogues on Religion &amp; Public Life)</h2><p><br><br><p>What role should religion play in shaping and implementing U.S. foreign policy?</p><br><br><p>The dominant attitude over the last half century on the subject of religion and international relations was expressed well by Dean Acheson, Harry Truman's secretary of state: "Moral Talk was fine preaching for the Final Day of Judgment, but it was not a view I would entertain as a public servant." Was Acheson right? How a nation "commits itself to freedom" has long been at the heart of debates about foreign aid, economic sanctions, and military intervention. Moral and faith traditions have much to say about what is required to achieve this end. And after September 11, no one can doubt the importance of religious beliefs in influencing relations among peoples and nations. The contributors to this volume come at the issue from very different perspectives and offer exceptional and unexpected insights on a question now at the forefront of American foreign policy.</p><br><br></p><p><br><br><p><br><br><b>J.

Part of a generation of artists that emerged in postwar Los Angeles, Ken Price transformed the art of ceramic sculpture. In his work, Price found inspiration in a diverse array of sources, including the Bauhaus school, traditional Southwestern pottery, and the counter-culture styles of the 1960s. Working with glazes and coloring his pieces with multiple layers of acrylic paint and making numerous intimate, smaller pieces as opposed to grand vessels, Price placed his own original stamp on the medium. This generously illustrated book also delves into Price&#x2019;s works on paper, which echo his sculptures in their brilliant colors and fantastical lines. This book fully integrates Price&#x2019;s sculptural work and his drawings. A scholarly essay explores Price&#x2019;s practice across different media as related to the tradition of ceramics and history of artistic modernism. Featuring more than 200 illustrations, the book offers readers in-depth access to Price&#x2019;s creative process. Ken Price emerges here as a multifaceted, cheerful iconoclast, both erudite and exuberant in his work and life.</p><p>Paul Schimmel is Vice President and Partner of Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel in Los Angeles.

Young examines the dominant trends in literary theory during the past thirty years, chronicling their effect on the teaching of literature and the imparting of a liberal education.</p><p>R. V. Young is Professor and Director of Graduate Programs in the English Department at North Carolina State University. He is a co-founder and joint editor of the John Donne Journal. His published essays and public lectures cover a wide variety of moral and religious topics as well as on Renaissance and twentieth-century literary theory. His books include At War with the Word: Literary Theory and Liberal Education, Richard Crashaw and the Spanish Golden Age, a bilingual edition of Justus Lipsius&#39; Principles of Letter Writing (with M. Thomas Hester), and Doctrine and Devotion in Seventeenth Century Literature (forthcoming).Plenty of readers and teachers find the theories that govern English departmentsAthe deconstruction of the '80s, or the Marxian New Historicism of the '90sAdepressing, limited, aesthetically insensitive, even morally disturbing. But few such readers and teachers will take comfort from this self-righteous book, which attacks most academic criticism on behalf of conservative Catholic theology. Young, a professor of English at North Carolina State University, defends the New Critics of the 1940s, attacks deconstruction's Nietzschean roots, slashes away at left-wing historicists and ties literary theorists' failings to judges' broad readings of the Constitution. Young is right to claim that the New Critics are routinely misunderstood and belittled, and fascinating when he showsAwith help from St. Augustine and Flannery O'ConnorAwhere deconstructionists and Christians agree (roughly, both deny that human work alone can find or fix meaning or value). His rhetoric sometimes overheats: "Derrida wasn't there when Jesus raised the dead, so he has made a career of killing the Logos and burning down the house of reason." Elsewhere, Young is less defensive than offensive: he comes out for quarantining AIDS patients "when necessary." When he later writes that many critics "test positive for Marxist assumptions even when they do not have active cases of Marxism," he comes off as tasteless, not funny. Young maintains that anyone who rejects total relativism ought to come around to Christian belief; for him, theory and abortion rights alike manifest "a culture that is intellectually and morally decadent." Readers who may be dismayed to find themselves agreeing with Young will, nevertheless, be gladdened by the prospect that, as he writes, "The salvation of literature will be effected, finally, by the inherent value of literary works themselves." <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sweet Life: Adventures On The Way To Paradise</h2><p>Filled with anecdotes about his tours and the behind-the-scenes realities of the music business, this autobiography reveals the musician&#39;s personal life and musical career, from his Brooklyn youth through his performance at Radio City Music Hall</p><p>One of the world's most popular musical performers tells the story of his career. Barry Alan Pincus, his father an Irish-American truck driver, his mother the daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, grew up poor in Brooklyn. Not a good academic student, he learned to play the piano, aspired to marry young, have children and become an executive at CBS. But soon he got part-time jobs as an accompanist and arrangermost notably for Bette Midler at the Continental Baths and later at Carnegie Halland was induced to sing some of his own songs on a recording. Success and fame came quickly. Even now he wonders at his sudden rise. This warmhearted memoir reveals a friendly, appealing man who maintains relationships with old friends and former sweethearts and believes in "people, loving, and music." The biggest lesson he's learned "is to follow your heart. If you do, you can't go wrong." Photos not seen by PW.

Yet his records have been well-crafted vehicles for his multiple talents. Writing from the heart, he describes his life as a series of ever-better adventures. As a gawky youth he discovered a source of strength in his love for music. His career took off after gigs with Bette Midler at Manhattan's raunchy Continental Baths. On tour, he established himself as a soloist as well as Midler's composer/arranger/accompanist. His persistence, perfectionism, and perspiration eventually paid off.

The English voice intrigued him. In the crowded London street behind him, his personal guard of a hundred gal-lowglass instantly stopped their purposeful march.<br><br>"How many?" someone yelled.<br><br>"Three!" came the shout from the center of St. Paul's churchyard.<br><br>Aidan nudged his horse forward into the area around the great church. A sea of booksellers, paupers, tricksters, merchants and rogues seethed around him. He could see the speaker now, just barely, a little lightning bolt of mad energy on the church steps.<br><br>"One to call a servant to pour the sack&#x2014;" she reeled in mock drunkenness "&#x2014;one to beat the servant senseless, one to botch the job and one to blame it on the French."<br><br>Her listeners hooted in derision. Then a man yelled, "That's four, wench!"<br><br>Aidan flexed his legs to stand in the stirrups. <em>Stirrups.</em><br><br>Until a fortnight ago, he had never even used such a device, or a curbed bit, either. Perhaps, after all, there was some use in this visit to England. He could do without all the fancy draping Lord Lumley had insisted upon, though. Horses were horses in Ireland, not poppet dolls dressed in satin and plumes.<br><br>Elevated in the stirrups, he caught another glimpse of the girl: battered hat crammed down on matted hair, dirty, laughing face, ragged clothes.<br><br>"Well," she said to the heckler, "I never said I could count, unless it be the coppers you toss me."<br><br>A sly-looking man in tight hose joined her on the steps. "I saves me coppers for them what entertains me." Boldly he snaked an arm around the girl and drew her snugly against him.<br><br>She slapped her hands against her cheeks in mock surprise. "Sir! Your codpiece flatters my vanity!"<br><br>The clink of coins punctuated a spate of laughter. A fat man near the girl held three flaming torches aloft. "Sixpence says you can't juggle them."<br><br>"Ninepence says I can, sure as Queen Elizabeth's white arse sits upon the throne," hollered the girl, deftly catching the torches and tossing them into motion.<br><br>Aidan guided his horse closer still. The huge Florentine mare he'd christened Grania earned a few dirty looks and muttered curses from people she nudged out of the way, but none challenged Aidan. Although the Londoners could not know he was the O Donoghue M�r of Ross Castle, they seemed to sense that he and his horse were not a pair to be trifled with. Perhaps it was the prodigious size of the horse; perhaps it was the dangerous, wintry blue of the rider's eyes; but most likely it was the naked blade of the shortsword strapped to his thigh.<br><br>He left his massive escort milling outside the churchyard and passing the time by intimidating the Londoners. When he drew close to the street urchin, she was juggling the torches. The flaming brands formed a whirling frame for her grinning, sooty face.<br><br>She was an odd colleen, looking as if she had been stitched together from leftovers: wide eyes and wider mouth, button nose, and spiky hair better suited to a boy. She wore a chemise without a bodice, drooping canion trews and boots so old they might have been relics of the last century.<br><br>Yet her Maker had, by some foible, gifted her with the most dainty and deft pair of hands Aidan had ever seen. Round and round went the torches, and when she called for another, it joined the spinning circle with ease. Hand to hand she passed them, faster and faster. The big-bellied man then tossed her a shiny red apple.<br><br>She laughed and said, "Eh, Dove, you don't fear I'll tempt a man to sin?"<br><br>Her companion guffawed. "I like me wenches made of more than gristle and bad jests, Pippa girl."<br><br>She took no offense, and while Aidan silently mouthed the strange name, someone tossed a dead fish into the spinning mix.<br><br>Aidan cringed, but the girl called Pippa took the new challenge in stride. "Seems I've caught one of your relatives, Mort," she said to the man who had procured the fish.<br><br>The crowd roared its approval. A few red-heeled gentlemen dropped coins upon the steps. Even after a fortnight in London Aidan could ill understand the Sassenach. They would as lief toss coins to a street performer as see her hanged for vagrancy.<br><br>He felt something rub his leg and looked down. A sleepy-looking whore curved her hand around his thigh, fingers inching toward the horn-handled dagger tucked into the top of his boot.<br><br>With a dismissive smile, Aidan removed the whore's hand. "You'll find naught but ill fortune there, mistress."<br><br>She drew back her lips in a sneer. The French pox had begun to rot her gums. "Irish," she said, backing away. "Chaste as a priest, eh?"<br><br>Before he could respond, a high-pitched mew split the air, and the mare's ears pricked up. Aidan spied a half-grown cat flying through the air toward Pippa.<br><br>"Juggle <em>that," </em>a man shouted, howling with laughter.<br><br>"Jesu!" she said. Her hands seemed to be working of their own accord, keeping the objects spinning even as she tried to step out of range of the flying cat. But she caught it and managed to toss it from one hand to the next before the terrified creature leaped onto her head and clung there, claws sinking into the battered hat.<br><br>The hat slumped over the juggler's eyes, blinding her.<br><br>Torches, apple and fish all clattered to the ground. The skinny man called Mort stomped out the flames. The fat man called Dove tried to help but trod instead upon the slimy fish. He skated forward, sleeves ripping as his pudgy arms cartwheeled. Just as he lost his balance, his flailing fist slammed into a spectator, who immediately threw himself into the brawl. With shouts of glee, others joined the fisticuffs. It was all Aidan could do to keep the mare from rearing.<br><br>Still blinded by the cat, the girl stumbled forward, hands outstretched. She caught the end of a bookseller's cart. Cat and hat came off as one, and the crazed feline climbed a stack of tomes, toppling them into the mud of the churchyard.<br><br>"Imbecile!" the bookseller screeched, lunging at Pippa.<br><br>Dove had taken on several opponents by now. With a wet <em>thwap, </em>he slapped one across the face with the dead fish.<br><br>Pippa grasped the end of the cart and lifted. The remaining books slid down and slammed into the bookseller, knocking him backward to the ground.<br><br>"Where's my ninepence?" she demanded, surveying the steps. People were too busy brawling to respond. She snatched up a stray copper and shoved it into the voluminous sack tied to her waist with a frayed rope. Then she fled, darting toward St. Paul's Cross, a tall monument surrounded by an open rotunda. The bookseller followed, and now he had an ally&#x2014;his wife, a formidable lady with arms like large hams.<br><br>"Come back here, you evil little monkey," the wife roared. "This day shall be your last!"<br><br>Dove was enjoying the fight by now. He had his opponent by the neck and was playing with the man's nose, slapping it back and forth and laughing.<br><br>Mort, his companion, was equally gleeful, squaring off with the whore who had approached Aidan earlier.<br><br>Pippa led a chase around the cross, the bookseller and his wife in hot pursuit.<br><br>More spectators joined in the fray. The horse backed up, eyes rolling in fear. Aidan made a crooning sound and stroked her neck, but he did not leave the square. He simply watched the fight and thought, for the hundredth time since his arrival, what a strange, foul and fascinating place London was. Just for a moment, he forgot the reason he had come. He turned spectator, giving his full attention to the antics of Pippa and her companions.<br><br>So this was St. Paul's, the throbbing heart of the city. It was more meeting place than house of worship to be sure, and this did not surprise Aidan. The Sassenach were a people who clung feebly to an anemic faith; all the passion and pageantry had been bled out of the church by the Rome-hating Reformers.<br><br>The steeple, long broken but never yet repaired, shadowed a collection of beggars and merchants, strolling players and thieves, whores and tricksters. At the opposite corner of the square stood a gentleman and a liveried constable. Prodded by the screeched urging of the bookseller's wife, they reluctantly moved in closer. The bookseller had cornered Pippa on the top step.<br><br>"Mort!" she cried. "Dove, help me!" Her companions promptly disappeared into the crowd. "Bastards!" she yelled after them. "Geld and splay you both!"<br><br>The bookseller barreled toward her. She stooped and picked up the dead fish, took keen aim at the bookseller and let fly.<br><br>The bookseller ducked. The fish struck the approaching gentleman in the face. Leaving slime and scales in its wake, the fish slid down the front of his silk brocade doublet and landed upon his slashed velvet court slippers.<br><br>Pippa froze and gawked in horror at the gentleman. "Oops," she said.<br><br>"Indeed." He fixed her with a fiery eye of accusation. Without even blinking, he motioned to the liveried constable.<br><br>"Sir," he said.<br><br>"Aye, my lord?"<br><br>"Arrest this, er, <em>rodent."</em><br><br>Pippa took a step back, praying the way was clear to make a run for it. Her backside collided with the solid bulk of the bookseller's wife.<br><br>"Oops," Pippa said again. Her hopes sank like a weighted corpse in the Thames.<br><br>"Let's see you worm your way out of <em>this </em>fix, missy," the woman hissed in her ear.<br><br>"Thank you," Pippa said cordially enough. "I intend to do just that." She put on her brightest I'm-an-urchin grin and tugged at a forelock. She had recently hacked off her hair to get rid of a particularly stubborn case of lice. "Good morrow, Your Worship."<br><br>The nobleman stroked his beard. "Not particularly good for you, scamp," he said. "Are you aware of the laws against strolling players?"<br><br>Her gaze burning with indignation, she looked right and left. "Strolling players?" she said with heated outrage. "Who? Where? To God, what is this city coming to that such vermin as strolling players would run loose in the streets?"<br><br>As she huffed up her chest, she furtively searched the crowd for Dove and Mortlock. Like the fearless gallants she knew them to be, her companions had vanished.<br><br>For a moment, her gaze settled on the man on the horse. She had noticed him earlier, richly garbed and well mounted, with a foreign air about him she could not readily place.<br><br>"You mean to say," the constable yelled at her, "that <em>you </em>are not a strolling player?"<br><br>"Sir, bite your tongue," she fired off. "I'm... I am..." She took a deep breath and plucked out a ready falsehood. "An evangelist, my lord. Come to preach the Good Word to the unconverted of St. Paul's."<br><br>The haughty gentleman lifted one eyebrow high. "The Good Word, eh? And what might that be?"<br><br>"You know," she said with an excess of patience. "The gospel according to Saint John." She paused, searching her memory for more tidbits gleaned from days she had spent huddled and hiding in church. An inveterate collector of colorful words and phrases, she took pride in using them. "The pistol of Saint Paul to the fossils."<br><br>"Ah." The constable's hands shot out. In a swift movement, he pinned her to the wall beside the <em>si quis </em>door. She twisted around to look longingly into the nave where the soaring stone pillars marched along Paul's Walk. Like a well-seasoned rat, she knew every cranny and cubbyhole of the church. If she could get inside, she could find another way out.<br><br>"You'd best do better than that," the constable said, "else I'll nail your foolish ears to the stocks."<br><br>She winced just thinking about it. "Very well, then." She heaved a dramatic sigh. "Here's the truth."<br><br>A small crowd had gathered, probably hoping to see nails driven through her ears. The stranger on horseback dismounted, passed his reins to a stirrup runner and drew closer.<br><br>The lust for blood was universal, Pippa decided. But perhaps not. Despite his savage-looking face and flowing black hair, the man had an air of reckless splendor that fascinated her. She took a deep breath. "Actually, sir, I <em>am </em>a strolling player. But I have a nobleman's warrant," she finished triumphantly.<br><br>"Have you, then?" His Lordship winked at the constable.<br><br>"Oh, aye, sir, upon my word." She hated it when gentlemen got into a playful mood. Their idea of play usually involved mutilating defenseless people or animals.<br><br>"And who might this patron be?"<br><br>"Why, Robert Dudley himself, the Earl of Leicester." Pippa threw back her shoulders proudly. How clever of her to think of the queen's perpetual favorite. She nudged the constable in the ribs, none too gently. "He's the queen's lover, you know, so you'd best not irritate me."<br><br>A few of her listeners' mouths dropped open. The nobleman's face drained to a sick gray hue; then hot color surged to his cheeks and jowls.<br><br>The constable gripped Pippa by the ear. "You lose, rodent." With a flourish, he indicated the haughty man. <em>"That </em>is the Earl of Leicester, and I don't believe he's ever seen you before."<br><br>"If I had, I would certainly remember," said Leicester.<br><br>She swallowed hard. "Can I change my mind?"<br><br>"Please do," Leicester invited.<br><br>"My patron is actually Lord Shelbourne." She eyed the men dubiously. "Er, he <em>is </em>still among the living, is he not?"<br><br>"Oh, indeed."<br><br>Pippa breathed a sigh of relief. "Well, then. He is my patron. Now I had best be go&#x2014;"<br><br>"Not so fast." The grip on her ear tightened. Tears burned her nose and eyes. "He is locked up in the Tower, his lands forfeit and his title attainted."<br><br>Pippa gasped. Her mouth formed an O.<br><br>"I know," said Leicester. "Oops."<br><br>For the first time, her aplomb flagged. Usually she was nimble enough of wit and fleet enough of foot to get out of these scrapes. The thought of the stocks loomed large in her mind. This time, she was nailed indeed.<br><br>She decided to try a last ditch effort to gain a patron. Who? Lord Burghley? No, he was too old and humorless. Walsingham? No, not with his Puritan leanings. The queen herself, then. By the time Pippa's claim could be verified, she would be long gone.<br><br>Then she spied the tall stranger looming at the back of the throng. Though he was most certainly foreign, he watched her with an interest that might even be colored by sympathy. Perhaps he spoke no English.<br><br>"Actually," she said, <em>"he </em>is my patron." She pointed in the direction of the foreigner. Be Dutch, she prayed silently. Or Swiss. Or drunk. Or stupid. Just play along.<br><br></p><h2>Parables by the Sea</h2><p>Using beautiful photographs of nature and personal reflections, the author explores the beauty of God&#39;s creation in each of us and His unique plan for us, and invites us to respond to Him.

Due to an oversight that presumably occurred in the hospital nursery, one twin in each pair was switched with a twin in the other pair. The result was two sets of unrelated &#x201c;fraternal&#x201d; twins&#x2015;Jorge and Carlos, who were raised in the lively city of Bogot�; and William and Wilber, who were raised in the remote rural village of La Paz, 150 miles away. Their parents and siblings were aware of the enormous physical and behavioral differences between the members of each set, but never doubted that the two belonged in their biological families. </p><p> Everyone&#x2019;s life unraveled when one of the twins&#x2015;William&#x2015;was mistaken by a young woman for his real identical twin, Jorge. Her &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; led to the truth&#x2015;that the alleged twins were not twins at all, but rather unrelated individuals who ended up with the wrong families.</p><p> Blending great science and human interest, <i>Accidental Brothers </i>by Nancy L. Segal and Yesika S. Montoya will inform and entertain anyone interested in how twin studies illuminate the origins of human behavior, as well as mother-infant identification and the chance events that can have profound consequences on our lives.</p></p><p><p>DR.

It is simultaneously a tale of two sets of identical twins accidentally separated at birth and a tale of the science of the genetic and environmental forces that makes us who we are.

He worked in London for a while, then in the family wine-merchants in Folkestone, Kent. In 1939, Brooke enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and reenlisted after the war as a Regular. The critical success of The Military Orchid (1948), the first volume of his autobiographical Orchid trilogy, provided the opportunity to buy himself out, and he immediately settled down to write, publishing some fifteen titles between 1948 and 1955, including the successive volumes of the trilogy, A Mine of Serpents (1949) and The Goose Cathedral (1950). His other published work includes two volumes of poetry, the novels The Image of a Drawn Sword (1950) and The Dog at Clambercrown (1955), as well as some technical works on botany. A perceptive reviewer, Brooke wrote critiques of Aldous Huxley, Elizabeth Bowen, Ronald Firbank, and John Betjeman. He also introduced and edited the journals and published works of Denton Welch.

He identified the future of Peru with the welfare of the Indian at a time when similar ideas were beginning to develop in Middle America and the Andean region. Generations of Peruvian and other Latin American social thinkers have been profoundly influenced by his writings.</p><p>Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality (Siete ensayos de interpretaci�n de la realidad peruana), first published in 1928, is Mari�tegui's major statement of his position and has gone into many editions, not only in Peru but also in other Latin American countries. The topics discussed in the essays&#x2014;economic evolution, the problem of the Indian, the land problem, public education, the religious factor, regionalism and centralism, and the literary process&#x2014;are in many respects as relevant today as when the book was written.</p><p>Mari�tegui's thinking was strongly tinged with Marxism. Because contemporary sociology, anthropology, and economics have been influenced by Marxism much more in Latin America than in North America, it is important that North Americans become more aware of Mari�tegui's position and accord it its proper historical significance.</p><p>Jorge Basadre, the distinguished Peruvian historian, in an introduction written especially for this translation, provides an account of Mari�tegui's life and describes the political and intellectual climate in which these essays were written.</p></p><p>Jose Carlos Mari�tegui was born in Moquegua, Peru, in 1894, but lived most of his brief life in Lima, where he died in 1930.

Serving Royal Thai Cuisine&#x2014;a lighter, more refined version of traditional Thai cooking&#x2014;the restaurants pride themselves on the authenticity of their menus. Their dedication and expertise is evident in such superb dishes as "Mud-Cha Chom Tarn" (steamed rainbow trout with lemon grass, tomatoes, and basil) and vegetarian specialties like "Thod Man Kao Phod" (sweet corn cakes).

His column has become one of the most influential of its kind in the country. He has been closely associated with the Blue Elephant for many years.The first Blue Elephant restaurant opened in Brussels in 1980, and there are now offshoots in London, Paris, and beyond, but with its elegant d?cor and attention to detail and authenticity, this is no ordinary restaurant chain.

However, Thai food lovers and other serious cooks are sure to find this lavishly illustrated volume of interest.

All these kitsch displays: the &#x201c;Peanut Brigade&#x201d; banner from &#x2019;76; the kids&#x2019; letters&#x2014;&#x201c;Please stop people from killing the whales&#x201d;&#x2014;and worse, Carter&#x2019;s replies to them, signed &#x201c;Jimmy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Rosalynn, without adding any words or warmth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two presidential couples filed out into the sunshine, toward the speakers&#x2019; platform, as the Fort McPherson army band played &#x201c;Hail to the Chief.&#x201d; Nancy looked over the four circular pavilions that had just been constructed on this hillside and thought they looked like a monotonous world&#x2019;s fair.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, as much as she tried, it was hard for her to dislike the Carters themselves. No matter how prudish and pickle-pussed the two of them might be, there was no getting away from how much they had done for her and Ronnie&#x2014;first, by defeating the Fords, whom she had no trouble at all disliking; and then, once in the White House, by screwing up so badly they seemed to have spent their whole four years rolling out a red carpet for the Reagans. Someone on Mike Deaver&#x2019;s staff used to refer to the thirty-ninth president as &#x201c;the Mastermind,&#x201d; insisting that Jimmy Carter was the greatest Republican strategist of all time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nancy looked back at the building they&#x2019;d just exited, as if to pay the design a compliment with some extra attention. She was actually trying to take comfort in the thought of how Carter&#x2019;s papers were now neatly stored in towering rows of banker&#x2019;s boxes that ran along a huge curving wall. Even failure could be made to look like accomplishment; something settled, <i>achieved</i>. So maybe there was hope for her and Ronnie if things really did fall apart.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, things could fall to such smithereens that even an illusion became impossible to construct. Nixon&#x2019;s library still wasn&#x2019;t built, and from what she heard it would be a penny arcade of cheap statues and props, while the documents it ought to house remained far away under the government&#x2019;s lock and key, serving the prison term that Nixon had avoided.<br> &nbsp;<br> She and Ronnie, along with the Carters, reached the platform. Applause&#x2014;and jeers&#x2014;could be heard from the crowd of spectators on the hillside. Nancy for a moment couldn&#x2019;t tell if the disapproval related to the Sandinistas or South Africa&#x2014;probably the latter, given that most of Atlanta&#x2019;s black establishment was here for the dedication. She looked over at Carter, who had just taken his seat; today was the first time she&#x2019;d seen him in five years, since the night Ronnie had sent all the ex-presidents off to Sadat&#x2019;s funeral. She regarded his pursed preacherly lips and thought of the handwritten notes to Sadat and Begin now on display in the library behind them, signed &#x201c;JC,&#x201d; as if they were memos from Christ himself, ordering the tribes in his Holy Land to make peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, she thought, it was decent of him to pout over the disrespect the protesters were showing Ronnie. But after a few more seconds she realized the reason for his sour expression: <i>he</i> was being protested, too! She strained to make out the chant that had gone up:<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>YOU TAKE THE HIGH ROAD! WE&#x2019;LL TAKE THE NO ROAD!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> On the flight down, one of the advance men had told her that a lot of locals opposed the four-lane highway being built to bring people here; the courts had actually halted construction for a while. These boos must be putting a bit of a damper on JC&#x2019;s sixty-second birthday&#x2014;not that his successor&#x2019;s unavoidable presence hadn&#x2019;t already cast a pall over it. Ninety percent of the news cameras here would be leaving halfway through the program, as soon as Ronnie finished his speech.<br> &nbsp;<br> She waved hello to Carter&#x2019;s little strawberry-blond granddaughter, who would cut the ribbon. The girl looked just the way awful little Amy, who&#x2019;d grown up into more of a slob than Patti, had looked during JC&#x2019;s White House days. His deciding to quote her on &#x201c;nuclear proliferation,&#x201d; as if she were some Quiz Kid, during the &#x2019;80 debate! Another gift from the gods.<br> &nbsp;<br> In one way it was good that she and Ronnie hadn&#x2019;t gotten to the White House sooner than they did. Had that happened, Patti, who actually did talk about nuclear proliferation, might have been living with them, as the world&#x2019;s most impossible college student, foisting people even worse than that horrible Caldicott woman on her soft touch of a father.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nancy looked at her tiny platinum wristwatch.<br> &nbsp;<br>###&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I often get invited to library dedications,&#x201d; spoke the president. &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t that many people still around who knew Andrew Carnegie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jimmy Carter displayed his large, recently whitened teeth to the crowd, imitating amusement while he stole a glance at Mondale, the other person here who&#x2019;d had the experience of playing straight man to this dunce on a national debate stage. Carter noticed, to his dismay, that Fritz&#x2019;s stomach, larger than when he&#x2019;d last seen it, was shaking agreeably. His own vice president was actually <i>enjoying</i> this.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> I can think of no other country on Earth where two political leaders could disagree so widely yet come together in mutual respect.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The old actor was <i>sounding</i> generous while really paying himself a compliment, letting the audience trick itself into thinking that the thirty-ninth president had a peanut shell&#x2019;s worth of respect for the fortieth. This business of pretending that we&#x2019;re &#x201c;all Americans&#x201d; just trivially separated by party labels was the domestic version of the &#x201c;moral equivalence&#x201d; that Reagan and his kind&#x2014;chief among them Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Democrat&#x2014;were always deploring on the international plane.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reagan was now praising Carter&#x2019;s mother, &#x201c;Miss Lillian,&#x201d; as well as his sister, Ruth, recently swallowed by the pancreatic cancer that stalked the family&#x2014;and was likely to get them all before long. He himself was expecting a short ex-presidency, and he was determined to do something different and redemptive with it.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> Jimmy Carter spoke these words in his inaugural address as governor of Georgia: &#x201c;I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</i><br> The man being quoted adjusted his smile to something grave and appreciative; he avoided meeting Coretta King&#x2019;s gaze, so as not to appear to be fishing for additional compliments. But a part of him longed to have a lapel microphone into which he could say to Reagan: &#x201c;Yes, and <i>you </i>started your 1980 campaign against me talking about states&#x2019; rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi.&#x201d; The thought of that murderous hamlet, with three civil rights workers buried in an earthen dam, left him righteous&#x2014;and ever so slightly uneasy. He had come a long way in his ideological life, as far forward as Reagan had gone backward, but he still hoped the papers from this gubernatorial campaign Reagan was referencing would remain unprocessed a while longer, lest some zealous researcher become intrigued by a few leaflets that might suggest why Jimmy Carter had actually gotten only five percent of the black Georgia vote in 1970.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> . . . using his gifts&#x2014;in particular, his superb intelligence&nbsp;. . .</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> Reagan made intelligence sound like a handicap, the way his aides had mocked his predecessor for actually reading the Air Force budget instead of just approving it. Looking out into the audience, Carter observed Sam Nunn, the sort of conservative Democrat on his way to extinction and thus, like a liberal Republican, highly respected. He knew that Nunn considered Reagan&#x2019;s supposed toughness to be the proper antidote to Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s own now-legendary weakness, and his jaw jutted forward at the thought of the false comparison. If <i>he&#x2019;d</i> made a deal for Daniloff like the one announced yesterday, there&#x2019;d have been a dozen cartoons in the papers this morning depicting him as a frightened bunny rabbit. Eight years ago, on <i>his</i> watch, two Russian spies had gotten fifty years in jail apiece, whereas Zakharov had just been allowed to leave the U.S. with a plea of <i>nolo contendere</i>&#x2014;and been given permission to come back in five years! That was Reagan&#x2019;s <i>toughness</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> . . . your countrymen still have vivid memories of your time in the White House&nbsp;. . . </i><br> &nbsp;<br> He could see two aides smirking, as if to say &#x201c;Do they ever,&#x201d; and then realized that one of them wasn&#x2019;t even Reagan&#x2019;s but a guy who&#x2019;d worked for <i>him</i>!<br> &nbsp;<br><i> . . . repairing to a quiet place to receive the latest word on the hostages you did so much to free, or studying in your hideaway office for the meeting at Camp David . . . </i><br> &nbsp;<br> It was as if the class football hero had been ordered to pay tribute to the class grind.<br> &nbsp;<br><i> And there&#x2019;s only one thing left to say. From the fortieth president to the thirty-ninth, happy birthday. And, Mr. President, if I could give you one word of advice: Life begins at seventy!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> As everyone laughed&#x2014;including Fritz, with god-awful gusto&#x2014;the former president realized that this was the line that would play on the evening news. There <i>you</i> go again, you son of a bitch. He had to trump him, or at least come up with something sufficiently gracious to guarantee a few words of his own on tonight&#x2019;s broadcasts. So at the top of his typewritten remarks, he quickly penciled in a new lead:<br> &nbsp;<br><i> Having heard you speak, Mr. President, I finally, for the first time, understand why you won and I lost.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It was the sort of lie he&#x2019;d once promised never to tell the American people. The truth was he&#x2019;d come to understand this long ago.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>###<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Marine Paintings of Carl G.

He is a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He divides his time between New York and Colorado.Short essays by novelist, short story author and prose stylist Salter (<i>Last Night</i>) explore his lifelong romance with Europe and Japan. These elegiac pieces recall his earliest travels as a soldier in WWII, when "the doors to the world were now open." Often his trips were colored by the authors he read; in 1950, he visited war-weary Paris for the first time, and in the essay "Europe," he remembers Babel's comparison of a Parisian streetwalker to the heroine of <i>War and Peace</i>: "Paris was like that," notes Salter. "It reminded me of something finer." In "Cemeteries," Salter revisits both high and low resting places, from Paris's P�re Lachaise to prairie graveyards of the American West. Several of the essays chronicle his infatuation with skiing the Alps. "The Skiing Life" features cameos of famous skiers, as well as a glimpse of Robert Redford as the star of <i>Downhill Racer</i>, for which Salter wrote the screenplay. In "Roads Seldom Travelled," Salter and his son tour Japan, transformed from the war years; while "Mishima's Choice" recounts his literary attraction to the Tokyo hotel the Hilltop, "where all desires are gratified but freedom is complete." While somewhat dated and worn, these essays showcase Salter's writerly touch. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lured back to active service, Smiley skillfully maneuvers his people -- "the no-men of no-man's land" -- into crisscrossing Paris, London, Germany, and Switzerland as he prepares for his own final, inevitable duel on the Berlin border with his Soviet counterpart and archenemy, Karla.</p></p><p>John le Carr� was born in 1931. His third novel, <i>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,</i> secured him a worldwide reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy: <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; The Honorable Schoolboy,</i> and <i>Smiley's People.</i> His novels include <i>The Little Drummer Girl, A Perfect Spy, The Russia House, Our Game, The Taileor of Panama,</i> and <i>Single &amp; Single.</i> John le Carr� lives in Cornwall.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Two seemingly unconnected events heralded the summons of Mr. George Smiley from his dubious retirement. The first had for its background Paris, and for a season the boiling month of August, when Parisians by tradition abandon their city to the scalding sunshine and the bus-loads of packaged tourists. </p><p> On one of these August days -- the fourth, and at twelve o'clock exactly, for a church clock was chiming and a factory bell had just preceded it -- in a <i>quartier</i> once celebrated for its large population of the poorer Russian �migr�s, a stocky woman of about fifty, carrying a shopping bag, emerged from the darkness of an old warehouse and set off, full of her usual energy and purpose, along the pavement to the bus-stop. The street was grey and narrow, and shuttered, with a couple of small <i>h�tels de passe</i> and a lot of cats. It was a place, for some reason, of peculiar quiet. The warehouse, since it handled perishable goods, had remained open during the holidays. The heat, fouled by exhaust fumes and unwashed by the slightest breeze, rose at her like the heat from a lift-shaft, but her Slavic features registered no complaint. She was neither dressed nor built for exertion on a hot day, being in stature very short indeed, and fat, so that she had to roll a little in order to get along. Her black dress, of ecclesiastical severity, possessed neither a waist nor any other relief except for a dash of white lace at the neck and a large metal cross, well fingered but of no intrinsic value, at the bosom. Her cracked shoes, which in walking tended outwards at the points, set a stern tattoo rattling between the shuttered houses. Her shabby bag, full since early morning, gave her a slight starboard list and told clearly that she was used to burdens. There was also fun in her, however. Her grey hair was gathered in a bun behind her, but there remained one sprightly forelock that flopped over her brow to the rhythm of her waddle. A hardy humour lit her brown eyes. Her mouth, set above a fighter's chin, seemed ready, given half a reason, to smile at any time. </p><p> Reaching her usual bus-stop, she put down her shopping bag and with her right hand massaged her rump just where it met the spine, a gesture she made often these days though it gave her little relief. The high stool in the warehouse where she worked every morning as a checker possessed no back, and increasingly she was resenting the deficiency. "Devil," she muttered to the offending part. Having rubbed it, she began plying her black elbows behind her like an old town raven preparing to fly. "Devil," she repeated. Then, suddenly aware of being watched, she wheeled round and peered upward at the heavily built man towering behind her. </p><p> He was the only other person waiting, and indeed, at that moment, the only other person in the street. She had never spoken to him, yet his face was already familiar to her: so big, so uncertain, so sweaty. She had seen it yesterday, she had seen it the day before, and for all she knew, the day before that as well -- my Lord, she was not a walking diary! For the last three or four days, this weak, itchy giant, waiting for a bus or hovering on the pavement outside the warehouse, had become a figure of the street for her; and what was more, a figure of a recognisable type, though she had yet to put her finger on which. She thought he looked <i>traqu�</i> -- hunted -- as so many Parisians did these days. She saw so much fear in their faces; in the way they walked yet dared not greet each other. Perhaps it was the same everywhere, she wouldn't know. Also, more than once, she had felt <i>his</i> interest in <i>her.</i> She had wondered whether he was a policeman. She had even considered asking him, for she had this urban cockiness. His lugubrious build suggested the police, so did the sweaty suit and the needless raincoat that hung like a bit of old uniform from his forearm. If she was right, and he <i>was</i> police, then -- high time too, the idiots were finally doing something about the spate of pilfering that had made a beargarden of her stock-checking for months. </p><p> By now the stranger had been staring down at her for some time, however. And he was staring at her still. </p><p> "I have the misfortune to suffer in my back, monsieur," she confided to him finally, in her slow and classically enunciated French. "It is not a large back but the pain is disproportionate. You are a doctor, perhaps? An osteopath?" </p><p> Then she wondered, looking up at him, whether he was ill, and her joke out of place. An oily gloss glistened on his jaw and neck, and there was an unseeing self-obsession about his pallid eyes. He seemed to see beyond her to some private trouble of his own. She was going to ask him this -- You are perhaps in love, monsieur? Your wife is deceiving you? -- and she was actually considering steering him into a caf� for a glass of water or a <i>tisane</i> when he abruptly swung away from her and looked behind him, then over her head up the street the other way. And it occurred to her that he really was afraid, not just <i>traqu�</i> but frightened stiff; so perhaps he was not a policeman at all, but a thief -- though the difference, she knew well, was often slight. </p><p> "Your name is Maria Andreyevna Ostrakova?" he asked her abruptly, as if the question scared him. </p><p> He was speaking French but she knew that it was not his mother tongue any more than it was her own, and his correct pronunciation of her name, complete with patronymic, already alerted her to his origin. She recognised the slur at once and the shapes of the tongue that made it, and she identified too late, and with a considerable inward start, the type she had not been able to put her finger on. </p><p> "If it is, who on earth are <i>you?"</i> she asked him in reply, sticking out her jaw and scowling. </p><p> He had drawn a pace closer. The difference in their heights was immediately absurd. So was the degree to which the man's features betrayed his unpleasing character. From her low position Ostrakova could read his weakness as clearly as his fear. His damp chin had set in a grimace, his mouth had twisted to make him look strong, but she knew he was only banishing an incurable cowardice. He is like a man steeling himself for a heroic act, she thought. Or a criminal one. He is a man cut off from all spontaneous acts, she thought. </p><p> "You were born in Leningrad on May 8, 1927?" the stranger asked. </p><p> Probably she said yes. Afterwards she was not sure. She saw his scared gaze lift and stare at the approaching bus. She saw an indecision near to panic seize him, and it occurred to her -- which in the long run was an act of near clairvoyance -- that he proposed to push her under it. He didn't, but he did put his next question in Russian -- and in the brutal accents of Moscow officialdom. </p><p> "In 1956, were you granted permission to leave the Soviet Union for the purpose of nursing your sick husband, the traitor Ostrakov? Also for certain other purposes?" </p><p> "Ostrakov was not a traitor," she replied, cutting him off. "He was a patriot." And by instinct she took up her shopping bag and clutched the handle very tight. </p><p> The stranger spoke straight over this contradiction, and very loudly, in order to defeat the clatter of the bus: "Ostrakova, I bring you greetings from your daughter Alexandra in Moscow, also from certain official quarters! I wish to speak to you concerning her! Do not board this car!" </p><p> The bus had pulled up. The conductor knew her and was holding his hand out for her bag. Lowering his voice, the stranger added one more terrible statement: "Alexandra has serious problems which require the assistance of a mother." </p><p> The conductor was calling to her to get a move on. He spoke with pretended roughness, which was the way they joked. "Come on, mother! It's too hot for love! Pass us your bag and let's go!" cried the conductor. </p><p> Inside the bus there was laughter; then someone shouted an insult -- old woman, keeps the world waiting! She felt the stranger's hand scrabbling inexpertly at her arm, like a clumsy suitor groping for the buttons. She pulled herself free. She tried to tell the conductor something but she couldn't; she opened her mouth but she had forgotten how to speak. The best she could manage was to shake her head. The conductor yelled at her again, then waved his hands and shrugged. The insults multiplied -- old woman, drunk as a whore at midday! Remaining where she was, Ostrakova watched the bus out of sight, waiting for her vision to clear and her heart to stop its crazy cavorting. Now it is I who need a glass of water, she thought. From the strong I can protect myself. God preserve me from the weak. </p><p> She followed him to the caf�, limping heavily. In a forced-labour camp, exactly twenty-five years before, she had broken her leg in three places in a coal slip. On this August 4th -- the date had not escaped her -- under the extreme duress of the stranger's message, the old sensation of being crippled came back to her. </p><p> The caf� was the last in the street, if not in all Paris, to lack both a juke-box and neon lighting -- and to remain open in August -- though there were bagatelle tables that bumped and flashed from dawn till night. For the rest, there was the usual mid-morning hubbub, of grand politics, and horses, and whatever else Parisians talked; there was the usual trio of prostitutes murmuring among themselves, and a sullen young waiter in a soiled shirt who led them to a table in a corner that was reserved with a grimy Campari sign. A moment of ludicrous banality followed. The stranger ordered two coffees, but the waiter protested that at midday one does not reserve the best table in the house merely in order to drink coffee; the <i>patron</i> had to pay the rent, monsieur! Since the stranger did not follow this flow of patois, Ostrakova had to translate it for him. The stranger blushed and ordered two ham omelettes with <i>frites,</i> and two Alsatian beers, all without consulting Ostrakova. Then he took himself to the men's room to repair his courage -- confident, presumably, she would not run away -- and when he returned his face was dry and his ginger hair combed, but the stink of him, now they were indoors, reminded Ostrakova of Moscow subways, and Moscow trams, and Moscow interrogation rooms. More eloquently than anything he could ever have said to her, that short walk back from the men's room to their table had convinced her of what she already feared. He was one of them. The suppressed swagger, the deliberate brutalisation of the features, the ponderous style in which he now squared his forearms on the table and with feigned reluctance helped himself to a piece of bread from the basket as if he were dipping a pen in ink -- they revived her worst memories of living as a disgraced woman under the weight of Moscow's malevolent bureaucracy. </p><p> "So," he said, and started eating the bread at the same time. He selected a crusty end. With hands like that he could have crushed it in a second, but instead he chose to prise ladylike flakes from it with his fat finger-ends, as if that were the official way of eating. While he nibbled, his eyebrows went up and he looked sorry for himself, me a stranger in this foreign land. "Do they know here that you have lived an immoral life in Russia?" he asked finally. "Maybe in a town full of whores they don't care." </p><p> Her answer lay ready on the tip of her tongue: <i>My life in Russia was not immoral. It was your system which was immoral.</i> </p><p> But she did not say it, she kept rigidly silent. Ostrakova had already sworn to herself that she would restrain both her quick temper and her quick tongue, and she now physically enjoined herself to this vow by grabbing a piece of skin on the soft inside of her wrist and pinching it through her sleeve with a fierce, sustained pressure under the table, exactly as she had done a hundred times before, in the old days, when such questionings were part of her daily life -- When did you last hear from your husband, Ostrakov, the traitor? Name all persons with whom you have associated in the last three months! With bitter experience she had learned the other lessons of interrogation too. A part of her was rehearsing them at this minute, and though they belonged, in terms of history, to a full generation earlier, they appeared to her now as bright as yesterday and as vital: never to match rudeness with rudeness, never to be provoked, never to score, never to be witty or superior or intellectual, never to be deflected by fury, or despair, or the surge of sudden hope that an occasional question might arouse. To match dullness with dullness and routine with routine. And only deep, deep down to preserve the two secrets that made all these humiliations bearable: her hatred of them; and her hope that one day, after endless drips of water on the stone, she would wear them down, and by a reluctant miracle of their own elephantine processes, obtain from them the freedom they were denying her. </p><p> He had produced a notebook. In Moscow it would have been her file but here in a Paris caf� it was a sleek black leatherbound notebook, something that in Moscow even an official would count himself lucky to possess. </p><p> File or notebook, the preamble was the same: "You were born Maria Andreyevna Rogova in Leningrad on May 8, 1927," he repeated. "On September 1, 1948, aged twenty-one, you married the traitor Ostrakov Igor, a captain of infantry in the Red Army, born of an Estonian mother. In 1950, the said Ostrakov, being at the time stationed in East Berlin, traitorously defected to Fascist Germany through the assistance of reactionary Estonian �migr�s, leaving you in Moscow. He took up residence, and later French citizenship, in Paris, where he continued his contact with anti-Soviet elements. At the time of his defection you had no children by this man. Also you were not pregnant. Correct?" </p><p> "Correct," she said. </p><p> In Moscow it would have been "Correct, Comrade Captain," or "Correct, Comrade Inspector," but in this clamorous French caf� such formality was out of place. The fold of skin on her wrist had gone numb. Releasing it, she allowed the blood to return, then took hold of another. </p><p> "As an accomplice to Ostrakov's defection you were sentenced to five years' detention in a labour camp, but were released under an amnesty following the death of Stalin in March, 1953. Correct?" </p><p> "Correct." </p><p> "On your return to Moscow, despite the improbability that your request would be granted, you applied for a foreign travel passport to join your husband in France. Correct?" </p><p> "He had cancer," she said. "If I had not applied, I would have been failing in my duty as his wife." </p><p> The waiter brought the plates of omelette and <i>frites</i> and the two Alsatian beers, and Ostrakova asked him to bring a <i>th� citron:</i> she was thirsty, but did not care for beer. Addressing the boy, she tried vainly to make a bridge to him, with smiles and with her eyes. But his stoniness repulsed her; she realised she was the only woman in the place apart from the three prostitutes. Holding his notebook to one side like a hymnal, the stranger helped himself to a forkful, then another, while Ostrakova tightened her grasp on her wrist, and Alexandr...</p></p><h2>Listen Up, You Primitive Screwheads!!!

Father Fox and his russet-furred, pointy-nosed family romp through the pages of these original American nursery rhymes, written and illustrated in the early 1970s by a pair of Vermonter sisters, Clyde and Wendy Watson. Each two-page spread features a quirky little verse on one side and framed pen, ink, and watercolor illustrations on the other. The extensive Fox family, in their patchwork-mended clothes, tumble over one another as they depict the very rhymes their father tells. Nonsense blends with nostalgia in both word and picture, and the upbeat rhythms beg to be tapped, stomped, or shouted out loud in such gems as: <blockquote> Ride your red horse down Vinegar Lane, <br> Gallop, oh gallop, oh gallop again! <br> Thistles &amp; foxholes &amp; fences beware: <br> I've seventeen children but none I can spare. <br> </blockquote> Joining the ranks of Edward Lear and Old Mother Goose, the Watson sisters created a classic with these marvelously zany "pennyrhymes." Welcome back! (Ages 3 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i><p>"I grew up on a farm in Vermont with seven younger brothers and sisters. Every morning my brother Peter and I went out to the barn and did our chores. My very favorite job was feeding the baby goats their bottles of milk. After we had our own breakfast, it was time for school-but I never left the house! Instead, I sat down at the big dining room table in front of the fireplace, with my books and pencils, and did what my mother told me, because she was my teacher.</p><p>"School at home was fun and interesting and did not take as long as school in a school building. I usually finished my work by lunchtime, and in the afternoon there were always exciting things to do with my brothers and sisters. We went exploring in the woods and pastures around our farm, or down to the river to fish. We liked to swim in the summertime and sled and ski and skate in the wintertime.</p><p>"If I wanted to be by myself, I could curl up with a book or go upstairs in our big house to visit my father's studio. That was where I found out what it was like to be an illustrator, because that is what my father was.</p><p>"In the evening, after we had fed the house cats and dogs, we all sat down and ate our own supper. That was usually a noisy time! Everyone wanted to talk at once. But when bedtime came, the house was finally quiet, and the only sound was the squeaking of the mice who lived in the walls.</p><p>"When I grew older, I went away and lived in the city for a while. But when my two children were small, I moved back to the country, and that is where I now live. All around me are the animals who have always been my special friends: chickens and pigs, mice, chipmunks, squirrels and birds, woodchucks, rabbits, foxes, beavers and porcupines. When I take a walk each day with my dog, I see the places where small creatures live and carry on their daily lives, and I try to put that in all of my books. And I also try to put in all that I have learned about what it is like to be alive in this exciting world."</p></p><h2>The Sex Diaries: Why Women Go Off Sex and Other Bedroom Battles</h2><p>&#39;From the time I started working as a sex therapist back in the early 1970s, people have been talking to me about their sex lives. What I hear about most is the business of negotiating the sex supply. How do couples deal with the strain of the man wishing and hoping while all she longs for is the bliss of uninterrupted sleep?&#39; In &#34;The Sex Diaries&#34; leading sex therapist Bettina Arndt uncovers the night-time drama being played out in bedrooms everywhere - the creeping hand and feigning of sleep, the staying up late in the hope that he will doze off. It is one of the great inconvenient truths of relationships that after the first blissful years together, most men want more sex than their female partners. Bettina Arndt recruited 98 couples to keep diaries, revealing their intimate negotiations over sex. Who feels like having sex? Who doesn&#39;t? And how do couples cope if one person wants it more than the other? She draws on her 35 years as a sex therapist and psychologist to provide an insightful analysis, and with her characteristic humour proposes a new approach to how couples can enjoy regular sex - and sustain loving relationships.</p><p>Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist, sex therapist and social commentator. As editor of the influential Forum magazine, she spent ten years talking about sex on television and radio, then writing about broader social issues for leading newspapers and magazines.

She takes her reader on an extraordinary journey through the history of the land of Israel and the development of modern Israeli food. I was delighted to visit all the different ethnic communities that have contributed to Israeli cuisine, and my mouth watered just imagining the feast that Joan Nathan describes."<br>--Teddy Kollek, former mayor of Jerusalem<br><br>In this richly evocative book, Joan Nathan captures the spirit of Israel today by exploring its multifaceted cuisine. She delves into the histories of the people already settled in this nearly barren land, as well as those who immigrated and helped to quickly transform it into a country bursting with new produce. It is a dramatic and moving saga, interlarded with more than two hundred wonderful recipes that represent all the varied ethnic backgrounds. Every recipe has a story, and through these tales the story of Israel emerges.<br><br>Nathan shows how a typical Israeli menu today might include Middle Eastern hummus, a European schnitzel (made with native-raised turkey) accompanied by a Turkish eggplant salad and a Persian rice dish, with, perhaps, Jaffa Orange Delight for dessert. On Friday nights she visits with home cooks who may be preparing a traditional Libyan, Moroccan, Italian, or German meal for their families, the Sabbath being the focal point of the week throughout Israel (all her recipes are accordingly kosher). And she takes us to markets overflowing with vegetables, fruits, herbs, and spices.<br><br>To gather the recipes and the stories, Nathan has been traveling the length and breadth of Israel for many years--to a Syrian Alawite village on the northern border for a vegetarian kubbeh and to Bet She'an for potato burekas; to the Red Sea for farmed sea bream and to the Sea of Galilee for St. Peter's fish; to Jerusalem's Bukharan Quarter for Iraqi pita bread baked in a wood-fired clay oven, to the Nahlaot neighborhood for Yemenite fried pancake-like bread, and to a Druse village for paper-thin lavash; to a tiny restaurant in Haifa for Turkish coconut cake and to a wedding at Kibbutz May'ayan Baruch in the upper Galilee for Moroccan sweet couscous; and to many, many other places. All the while, she seeks out biblical connections between ancient herbs and vegetables and their modern counterparts, between Esau's mess of pottage and today's popular taboulleh, and she delights us with tales of all she encounters.<br><br>Throughout, Joan Nathan shows us how food in this politically turbulent land can be a way of breaking down barriers between Jews, Moslems, and Christians. Generously illustrated with colorful photographs, this enormously engaging book is one to treasure, not only as a splendid cookbook but also as a unique record of life in Israel.</p><p><br>"Joan Nathan has created a masterful blend of food and culture.

It is a remarkable cornucopia of Israel's Jewish, Muslim, and Christian culinary traditions, including recipes being made in Israel today that originated everywhere from Morocco to Argentina to Transylvania to Rome. There are so many new dishes to try! In short, The Foods of Israel Today is a mitzvah and a mechiah."<br>-Sara Moulton<br><br>"Joan Nathan's cookbook is an intensely individual one, full of personal anecdotes and excerpts of relevant stories by various authors. I read this cookbook like a novel and really enjoyed learning more about the culture and cuisine of Israel. I also had the most incredible urge to try every recipe while I was reading the cookbook-a sure sign that a cookbook will be a hit."<br>-Daniel Boulud<br><br>"I have been waiting a long time for this book. The years Joan Nathan has taken to 'get it right' show on every page. No one has dealt with Israel with this combination of scholarship, good storytelling, and the pure joy of a gifted cook. This is one of those books that softens and opens the 'otherness' of a complex country. Thank you, Joan, for a masterful piece of work and for building a much-needed bridge. It goes on my short shelf of classics."<br>-Lynne Rossetto Kasper<br><br>"Joan Nathan's new book is just wonderful and so accessible. I think it is a major work." <br>-PaulaWolfert <br><br> "Israel may be the world's smallest melting pot and no one is more qualified than Joan Nathan to chronicle its culinary riches. In this remarkable book, she has written the 'greatest story never told.' Every recipe nourished my spirit, every page made me hunger for Israel's shared table."<br> -Rozanne Gold<br>Joan Nathan was born in Providence, Rhode Island.

Her rulers rose from Electors to Kings, and from Kings to Emperors. It is a dramatic story, and H. W. Koch fills a major gap in English-language literature with this comprehensive account. It traces the origins and rise of the Prussian state from the thirteenth century to the causes and consequences of its incorporation into the German Empire.</p><p><p>`Dr Koch's book...should long remain the standard work in its field.'<br> <br>The Times Higher Education Supplement<br> </p></p><h2>Bluestocking Guide: Applying the Clipper Ship Strategy</h2><p>"A Bluestocking Guide: Applying the Clipper Ship Strategy" is designed to reinforce and enhance a student's understanding of the subject matter presented in the primer "The Clipper Ship Strategy" an Uncle Eric book by Richard J. Maybury. Comprehension Questions are given for each chapter and may include Definition, True/False, and/or Short Answer/Fill-in questions. &nbsp;Answers are located in the back of the study guide. (Note: &nbsp;student answers to some questions/exercises do not always have definitive answers, in which case the notation "answers will vary" will appear.) Application Exercises are also given. Generally, these ask the student to apply the knowledge he/she learned from a given chapter to "real world" situations so that the student may personalize the information and better retain and apply the knowledge gained from the primer. &nbsp;Application Exercises typically include Discussion, Essay, and Research assignments. A comprehensive final exam is also included. In addition to assisting the student in the retention of the subject matter, the study guide will serve as documentation of course completion. Timeframe for Study: Bluestocking Guides are organized to allow the instructor flexibility in designing the ideal course of study for the student. Therefore, there is no "right" or "wrong" timeframe for covering the material; the instructor should tailor the study of the primer and study guide to the student's unique school schedule, learning style and age. For example, younger students might only complete comprehension exercises in the study guide, whereas older students may complete additional application exercises and suggestions for further reading/study. Ideally, the student should read the chapter from the primer and then immediately answer the corresponding questions in the study guide. For Essay and Research assignments, a project may require several days or weeks to complete. It is best that the instructor preview these assignments to select those most appropriate for the student and the timeframe available. An easy-to-apply rule of thumb for determining length of study is to divide the number of chapters in a primer by the number of weeks the instructor plans to study the subject/book. &nbsp;Some instructors may choose to complete the primer in a few short weeks, in which case multiple chapters may need to be covered for each lesson period. &nbsp;Others may cover the primer over the course of a semester, in which case only one or two chapters per week will need to be assigned. (Note: &nbsp;Chapter lengths vary, so sometimes a student may easily be able to read more than one chapter per lesson.) &nbsp;The key is to move quickly enough so that the student is engaged with learning and also able to absorb all concepts fully. The student's performance on end-of-chapter Questions and Assignments from the study guide should be a good indication of this. This guide is 8-1/2" x 11" in size.<br><br>Description of the primer, "The Clipper Ship Strategy": Conventional wisdom says that when the government expands the money supply, the money descends on the economy in a uniform blanket. This is incorrect. The money is injected into specific locations causing hot spots or "cones." &nbsp;Mr. Maybury explains a system for tracking and profiting from these cones, for locating genuine money-making opportunities, and for avoiding those which are false or dangerous. &nbsp;Includes step-by-step instructions, and clever illustrations that make the system easy to understand. Explains how to cope with recessions and avoid unemployment. Like all the Uncle Eric books, "The Clipper Ship Strategy" was written to be able to stand alone. &nbsp;Please note, however, that "The Clipper Ship Strategy" is the second sequel to "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy". "The Money Mystery" is the first sequel to "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy."</p><p>About Kathryn Daniels: Kathryn Daniels was born in Sacramento, California.

But many kids don't know the Goodall story and will love this chance to hit the ground in Tanzania and learn about the remarkable scientist and her beloved chimp friends. With dozens of vintage photographs, Goodall recounts her early research in Gombe National Park, including a recap of her childhood and how she came to know Louis Leakey and first enter the bush. With clear and careful prose, Goodall explains her findings about chimp communities and communication, the role of hierarchies, and what sort of threats chimpanzees face today. Best of all, Goodall's account always keeps curious young readers in mind, even relating some of her mistakes, such as when she became too close to her subjects and interfered with her own research.<p> Young protoscientists will appreciate Goodall's frank descriptions, from kerosene-can-assisted dominance displays to her discovery that chimps engage in hunting and warlike behaviors, and hopefully, such detail will inspire further interest in the future of chimpanzees and other threatened species. Proceeds from the book will go to Roots &amp; Shoots, a "grassroots environmental and humanitarian education program for young people" under the Jane Goodall Institute. Because "hundreds of roots and shoots--young people like you--around the globe can break through and make the world a better place for all living things." (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Striking an admirable balance between scientific reporting and deep affection, Goodall's (My Life with the Chimpanzees) impassioned introduction to the creatures to whom she's dedicated her life's work may well ignite in readers a similar appreciation. "Chimpanzees are more like humans than any other creature living today," argues Goodall. She supports her claims with firsthand observations of chimp communication, relationships and behavior culled from 41 years of experience, primarily in what is now Gombe National Park in Tanzania. She describes with humor how the knuckle-walking chimps "don't like putting their hands on the ground when it is cold or wet," and records familiar sibling dynamics as Frodo follows his older brother Freud's examples. Dramatic close-up color photographs illustrate Goodall's unique relationship with her subjects; in one, she grooms alpha male David Greybeard; in another stunning scene, Jou-Jou, newly freed from captivity in a Congolese zoo, reaches out to touch Goodall's forehead. She documents the chimps' recognizable emotions of sadness, affection and fear, as well as their ability to create tools, learn American Sign Language and operate computers. An especially poignant story tells of eight-year-old Flint, who was with his mother, Flo, when she died: "He died six weeks after losing Flo. I think he died of grief." In closing, Goodall catalogues the many threats to the animals in the wild and in captivity, yet she ends this remarkable volume with a note of hope and invites readers to join her efforts in protecting chimps worldwide.

Even as he goes through the motions of everyday life, however, inside he feels nothing. The explanation for this emotional void lies in the years he spent as a blacked-out drunk before pulling his life together&#x2015;years in which he knows he committed acts he doesn't remember. Then a woman from his past turns up at a gala for his wife's new gig at a magazine called <i>Diablerie </i>and makes it clear that she remembers something he doesn't. Their encounter sets wheels in motion that will propel Dibbuk toward new knowledge, and perhaps the chance to feel again. With the same erotic force as <i>Killing Johnny Fry</i>, but grounded in a far darker vision of human nature, <i>Diablerie </i>is a transfixing new novel from one of our most powerful writers.</p></p><p><p><b>Walter Mosley </b>is one of the most versatile and admired writers in America today. He is the author of more than twenty-eight critically acclaimed books, including the major bestselling mystery series featuring Easy Rawlins. His work has been translated into twenty-one languages and includes literary fiction, science fiction, political monographs, and a young adult novel. His short fiction has been widely published, and his nonfiction has appeared in the <i>New York Times </i>magazine and the <i>Nation</i>, among other publications. He is the winner of numerous awards, including an O. Henry Award, a Grammy, and the PEN American Center's Lifetime Achievement Award. He lives in New York City.</p>Walter Mosley's novels are full of everyday people with everyday problems. They rarely feature big, brave action heroes who laugh at death. DIABLERIE is odd, even by Mosley standards. The main character (not "hero," please) is an amoral computer programmer who can't seem to feel anything but lust.

The initial clues are few, and identification is impossible because the victims--all young women--were discovered with their lower jaws and teeth removed. The case hits close to home when the daughter of Du Pr�'s lover, Madelaine, turns up missing. Working with G-man Harvey Wallace, Du Pr� begins, almost unconsciously at first, to mirror the patterns of a serial killer in a desperate attempt to prevent another death, knowing too well that his descent into madness could have a profound and permanent effect. <i>Notches</i> is the fourth book in a series of Du Pr� mysteries in which Peter Bowen infuses elements of Indian folklore into his sparse writing style to create deep characters who reveal much in few words.Gabriel Du Pr&#x201a;, natural man of Montana, a member of the far- ranging Metis Indian tribe and a gifted fiddler, is sorely aggrieved that killers are making the trailways unsafe for women and children. Informally deputized by the local weak-stomached sheriff--a friend of his--Du Pr&#x201a; quickly becomes privy to a pattern of highway-related rape/killings that go back many years and involve more than one perpetrator. In his fourth outing (Wolf, No Wolf, p. 174, etc.), the earthy Du Pr&#x201a; again manhunts in a way that puts to good use his creator's considerable knowledge of native lore. While remaining true to his tribal ethos, the deputy forms extraprofessional bonds with those who share his outrage: the Blackfoot FBI man Harvey ``Weasel Fat'' Wallace; his profane, well- built female colleague Agent Pideron (almost one of the boys); and the tattooed trucker and sometime outlaw Rolly Challis, who becomes a friend after rescuing the runaway daughter of Du Pr&#x201a;'s fiery lover, Madeleine. Despite warnings from his government-employee friends not to get involved, Du Pr&#x201a; responds to Madeleine's exhortations and weathers both drinking bouts and dream quests, achieving a rough justice in the process. The local color is fairly garish, but Bowen writes a provocative, involving adventure. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He first offers a fascinating account of anti-Semitism in the West to show why, for most of that time, Jews quite sensibly concluded that they had much more to fear from the right than the left. But since the Six Day War of 1967, he argues, this position has no longer made sense, and yet most Jews go on supporting the Democratic Party and the liberal agenda. Reviewing the history of Jewish political attitudes and thoroughly examining the available evidence, he then demonstrates that all the usual explanations-such as a passion for justice allegedly deriving from the prophets of the Hebrew Bible-are either inadequate or flat-out false. Finally he proposes his own answer to the great puzzle of why most Jews remain as committed to liberalism as ever. <br><br>There is no more vigorous thinker or skilled polemicist in American intellectual life than Norman Podhoretz. In <i>Why Are Jews Liberals?</i> he sums up his thinking on the political inclinations of his fellow Jews-in the process confounding conventional wisdom and changing the way we view American politics.</p><p>NORMAN PODHORETZ, who was the editor in chief of <i>Commentary</i> for thirty-five years, is now an adjunct fellow of the Hudson Institute and the author of numerous bestselling books, including <i>Making It</i>,<i> Breaking Ranks</i>,<i> Ex-Friends</i>,<i> My Love Affair with America</i>,<i> The Prophets</i>, and <i>World War IV</i>. He holds the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.1<br>THE "WITNESS" DOCTRINE<br>The reason the story of how the Jews became liberals is so long is that it begins very far back--all the way back to the birth of Christianity out of the womb of Judaism about two thousand years ago. The earliest Christians (not yet known by that name) were a dissident sect within Judaism. They did not, to begin with, see themselves as belonging to a new religion: they were, rather, Jews who continued observing the laws of Judaism but who differed from most of their fellow Jews in their belief that the Messiah (or the "Christ") had come in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. It was only with the conversion of Saint Paul some thirty-five years after the crucifixion of Jesus that the break with Judaism was initiated.<br>Paul (ne Saul) was himself a Jew ("I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin"), and he sometimes denied that God had now rejected the people He had formerly chosen ("They are beloved for the sake of their forefathers").&nbsp;But he interpreted the coming of Jesus as signifying, and indeed requiring, the abrogation of The old Law given by God at Mount Sinai to His chosen people, the Jews, and under which they had always lived ("But now," he tells his fellow Jews, "we are delivered from the law").<br>In the years following Paul's death, a great debate broke out over the relationship between Christianity and Judaism, with the radical theologian Marcion (ca. 85-160) holding that the Hebrew Bible, the Bible of the Jews, the "Old Testament," was not the word of God but the work of the Devil and must therefore be entirely shunned and repudiated. But this idea was declared heretical, and it was Paul's view--namely, that the "Old Testament" had been valid up until the coming of Jesus and remained valid as the prelude to, and the prophetic foreteller of, a "New Testament"--that ultimately prevailed. It followed that the Jews, having refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah sent to them by God for their deliverance from death, had now been superseded as His chosen people by the Christian community (or Church).<br>But if the Jews were no longer the chosen people, what were they then? Paul asked: "Hath God cast away His people?" and to his own question he answered, "God forbid. . . . God hath not cast away His people which He foreknew."4 Yet there were also passages in the Letters of Paul that could, and would, be taken as a warrant for regarding those who continued to live by the Law of Judaism as "carnally minded" rather than "spiritually minded," and that this made them enemies of God ("because the carnal mind is enmity against God").<br>Ominous as this idea was, however, what proved to be even worse for the Jews was the charge made against them in other parts of the New Testament, especially the Gospels of Matthew and John. For there are passages in these books that hold the Jewish people responsible for the crucifixion of the son of God--and not only the Jews living at the time of Jesus's sojourn on earth, but even their descendants unto all the generations that followed ("Then answered all the people and said, His blood be on us, and on our children"). Hence the Jewish people as a whole are condemned as the spawn of the Devil ("Ye are of your father the Devil and your will is to do your father's desire").<br>In a fascinating speculative comment on the ambivalence of the New Testament's conception of the Jews, R. J. Zwi Werblowski, who was for many years the Martin Buber Professor of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, writes:<br>Had the Jews disappeared from the stage of history, it would have been possible [for Christianity] to relate to them more positively as a preparatory phase in the coming of God's kingdom. Had the Church severed its ties to its Israelite antecedents and completely rejected the "Old Testament" and the "Jewish God" (as demanded by Marcion) . . . , then Christianity would have been a hostile but essentially separate religion. The Church, however, insistently maintained that it was the direct continuation of that divine action in history of which the election of Israel was a major part. Yet the Jews continued to exist.<br>Because the Jews refused to disappear, what started as ambivalence developed into outright hostility. Marcion may have been excommunicated and his doctrine declared a heresy, but with a little help from the accusations I have just cited from the Gospels of Matthew and John, a version of the Marcionite heresy smuggled its way into the writing and preaching of other early Fathers of the Church like Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom.&nbsp; The eminent historian Cecil Roth warns against exaggerating how bad conditions were for the Jews in the "Dark Ages," and we do well to take his caution into account. Nevertheless it is beyond dispute that much mob violence against the Jews was triggered in the coming centuries--and, as we shall see, not only in the medieval world--by the anti-Jewish ideas scattered throughout the New Testament, and spread far and wide by the sermons of prelates and priests. There is nothing surprising about this. What may, however, seem surprising, at least at first sight, is how long it took for the image of the Jew as a "Christ-killer" and as the "_anti-Christ" to trickle down into the popular mind. As late as the fourth century C.E., John Chrysostom complained that Christians who knew no better were living on an equal footing with their Jewish neighbors, who, true to the Pauline characterization of them as "carnally minded," were marked by extravagance, gluttony, and dissolute living, and who, true to the Gospel accounts of their role in the crucifixion of Jesus, were guilty of deicide.<br>Evidently this vexatious problem of good relations between ordinary Christians and Jews refused to go away, so that it was still eliciting complaints from princes of the Church at the time of Charlemagne (ninth century). "Things have reached a stage," declared Agobard, the Archbishop of Lyon,<br><i>where ignorant Christians claim that the Jews preach better than our priests. . . . Some Christians even celebrate the Sabbath with the Jews and violate the holy repose of Sunday. . . . Men of the people, peasants, allow themselves to be plunged into such a sea of errors that they regard the Jews as the only people of God, and consider that they combine the observance of a pure religion and a truer faith than ours</i>.<br>But what may seem even more surprising than these friendly relations between Jews and Christians in the early Middle Ages is the reversal of roles between "men of the people" and the princes of the Church that later took place. For there came a time when Jews were often protected from mob violence by the very Catholic authorities whose ideas were the source of it. During the First Crusade (1095-96), when there were horrible massacres in France and Germany of Jewish communities unlucky enough to be living in the path of the Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land, the Bishop of Speyer and the Archbishop of Cologne both used force to stop the killings. The Bishop of Speyer even went so far as to hang the ringleaders. The Archbishop of Mainz also tried to intervene, but he failed and narrowly escaped being slaughtered himself. Then, in the twelfth century, the Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux, though he himself had been instrumental in launching the Second Crusade, helped to head off a new wave of massacres by warning that they would bring Divine retribution.<br>I can well imagine that these courageous men--and courageous they certainly were--thought they were acting as good Christians. But if so, it was not necessarily in the spirit of Christian love. (Even Bernard, the best of them from the Jewish point of view, referred to Jews with such epithets as "venomous," "coarse," and "wicked.")12 For around the end of the fourth century, no less an authority than Saint Augustine, the greatest of all the early Christian theologians, had promulgated the doctrine that it was the will of God for the Jews to be dispersed and kept in a state of abject misery. He further decreed, however--and it was out of obedience to this codicil that princes of the Church like the Bishop of Speyer sometimes protected Jews from murderous assaults--that they were not to be killed and that they must also be permitted to practice their religion. In this way the wretched condition they had brought upon themselves by rejecting and crucifying Jesus, and continuing to reject him, would serve as a "witness" to the truth of Christianity.<br>In a similar vein, the greatest Christian theologian of the High Middle Ages, Saint Thomas Aquinas, declared in the thirteenth century that<br><i>in consequence of their sin Jews were destined to perpetual servitude . . . save for the sole proviso that [sovereigns] do not deprive them of all that is necessary to sustain life.</i><br>Adding his own, more detailed, exposition of the same point, Pope Innocent III declared in 1205:<br><i>The Lord made Cain a wanderer and a fugitive over the earth, but set a mark on him, . . . lest any finding him should slay him. Thus the Jews, against whom the blood of Jesus Christ calls out, although they ought not to be killed, lest the Christian people forget the Divine Law, yet as wanderers ought they to remain upon the earth, until their countenance be filled with shame and they seek the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord. That is why blasphemers of the Christian name ought . . . to be forced into the servitude of which they made themselves deserving when they raised sacrilegious hands against Him Who had come to confer true liberty upon them, thus calling down His blood upon themselves and upon their children.</i><br>In addition to mandating a degree of physical protection against murderous attacks, the "witness" doctrine sometimes compelled efforts by the ecclesiastical authorities to deny the false charges that often triggered such attacks. Thus, Innocent III's successor, Innocent IV, wrote in 1247 that<br><i>Christians charge falsely . . . that [the Jews] hold a communion rite . . . with the heart of a murdered child; and should the cadaver of a dead man...</i></p><h2>Will in the World : How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare</h2><p>The theatre for which Shakespeare wrote and acted was a cut-throat commercial entertainment industry. Yet his plays were also intensely alert to the social and political realities of their times. Shakespeare had to make concessions to the commercial world, for the theatre company in which he was a shareholder had to draw some 1,500 to 2,000 paying customers a day into the round wooden walls of the playhouse to stay afloat and competition from rival companies was fierce. The key was not so much topicality - with government censorship and with repertory companies recycling the same scripts for years. Instead, Shakespeare had to engage with the deepest desires and fears of his audience. Will in the World is about an amazing success story that has resisted explanation: it aims to be the first fully satisfying account of Shakespeare&#39;s character and the blossoming of his talent. There have, of course, been many biographies of Shakespeare. The problem each one faces is the thin amount of material surrounding his life. They lead us through the available traces but leave us no closer to understanding how the playwright&#39;s astonishing achievements came about.</p><p>There's no shortage of good Shakespearean biographies. But Stephen Greenblatt, brilliant scholar and author of <i>Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare</i>, reminds us that the "surviving traces" are "abundant but thin" as to known facts. He acknowledges the paradox of the many biographies spun out of conjecture but then produces a book so persuasive and breathtakingly enjoyable that one wonders what he could have done if the usual stuff of biographical inquiry--memoirs, interviews, manuscripts, and drafts--had been at his disposal. Greenblatt uses the "verbal traces" in Shakespeare's work to take us "back into the life he lived and into the world to which he was so open." Whenever possible, he also ushers us from the extraordinary life into the luminous work. The result is a marvelous blend of scholarship, insight, observation, and, yes, conjecture--but conjecture always based on the most convincing and inspired reasoning and evidence. Particularly compelling are Greenblatt's discussions of the playwright's relationship with the university wit Robert Greene (discussed as a chief source for the character of Falstaff) and of <i>Hamlet</i> in relation to the death of Shakespeare's son Hamnet, his aging father, and the "world of damaged rituals" that England's Catholics were forced to endure. <p></p><i>Will in the World</i> is not just the life story of the world's most revered writer. It is the story, too, of 16th- and 17th-century England writ large, the story of religious upheaval and political intrigue, of country festivals and brutal public executions, of the court and the theater, of Stratford and London, of martyrdom and recusancy, of witchcraft and magic, of love and death: in short, of the private but engaged William Shakespeare in his remarkable world. Throughout the book, Greenblatt's style is breezy and familiar. He often refers to the poet simply as Will. Yet for all his alacrity of style and the book's accessibility, <i>Will in the World</i> is profoundly erudite, an enormous contribution to the world of Shakespearean letters. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i> <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>Interview with Stephen Greenblatt</b> <br>Stephen Greenblatt shares his thoughts about what make Shakespeare Shakespeare and why the Bard continues to fascinate us endlessly.</p>Stephen Greenblatt is the John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University and is the founder of the school of literary criticism known as New Historicism.

Focusing on the public debates over legalized sexual commerce and the spread of sexually transmitted disease in the first half of the twentieth century, Katherine Bliss argues that political change was compromised time and again by reformers' own antiquated ideas about gender and class, by prostitutes' outrage over official attempts to undermine their livelihood, and by clients' unwillingness to forgo visiting brothels despite revolutionary campaigns to promote monogamy, sexual education, and awareness of the health risks associated with sexual promiscuity. </p><p>In the Mexican public's imagination, the prostitute symbolized the corruption of the old regime even as her redemption represented the new order's potential to dramatically alter gender relations through social policy. Using medical records, criminal case files, and letters from prostitutes and their patrons to public officials, <em>Compromised Positions</em> reveals how the contradictory revolutionary imperatives of individual freedom and public health clashed in the effort to eradicate prostitution and craft a model of morality suitable for leading Mexico into the modern era.</p></p><p>Katherine Elaine Bliss is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.<p>Katherine Elaine Bliss is Associate Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts.

Everything they have is borrowed from the &#39;human beans&#39;, who don&#39;t even know they exist. Arrietty&#39;s father, Pod, is an expert Borrower - he can scale curtains using a hatpin and bring back a doll&#39;s teacup without breaking it. Girls aren&#39;t supposed to go borrowing but as Arrietty is an only child her father breaks the rule. But then Arrietty makes friends with a boy - a &#39;human bean&#39; - and from that moment danger is never far away for, above all else, they must avoid the great disaster of &#39;being seen&#39;. The &#34;Borrowers Afield&#34;: The Pod family escape to the fields where their cousins live, but it&#39;s a long and dangerous journey. At last they find a new home and adapt to country life. The &#34;Borrowers Afloat&#34;: Homeless again, Arrietty looks forward to a life away from the dark country cottage, to one full of sunshine. The &#34;Borrowers Aloft&#34;: The family are now living in the model village of Little Fordham - a complete village tailored to their size. All they have to do is avoid being seen by the visitors, but one night the owner of a rival village comes with a cardboard box ready to catch them ...&#34;The Borrowers Avenged&#34;: Pod, Homily and Arrietty have managed to escape with the help of Spiller. They move into the old rectory where they live happily until the Potters come looking for them. After a horrifying encounter in the church, the Potters get their just desserts and the Borrowers can live peacefully once and for all.

There followed four more Borrowers books: The Borrowers Afield (1955), The Borrowers Afloat (1959), The Borrowers Aloft (1961) and The Borrowers Avenged (1982).

As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he&#x2019;ll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

He lives in Maine with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.<br>&nbsp;<br>www.stephenking.com<i>Excerpted from Chapter One<br></i><br>Jack Torrance thought: Officious little prick. <br><br>Ullman stood five-five, and when he moved, it was with the prissy speed that seems to be the exclusive domain of all small plump men. The part in his hair was exact, and his dark suit was sober but comforting. I am a man you can bring your problems to, that suit said to the paying customer. To the hired help it spoke more curtly: This had better be good, you. There was a red carnation in the lapel, perhaps so that no one on the street would<br>mistake Stuart Ullman for the local undertaker. <br><br>As he listened to Ullman speak, Jack admitted to himself that he probably could not have liked any man on that side of the desk&#x2014;under the circumstances. <br><br>Ullman had asked a question he hadn&#x2019;t caught. That was bad; Ullman was the type of man who would file such lapses away in a mental Rolodex for later consideration. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I asked if your wife fully understood what you would be taking on here. And there&#x2019;s your son, of course.&#x201d; He glanced down at the application in front of him. &#x201c;Daniel. Your wife isn&#x2019;t a bit intimidated by the idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy is an extraordinary woman.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And your son is also extraordinary?&#x201d; <br><br>Jack smiled, a big wide PR smile. &#x201c;We like to think so, I suppose. He&#x2019;s quite self-reliant for a five-year-old.&#x201d; <br><br>No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack&#x2019;s application back into a file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of the in/out were empty, too.<br><br>Ullman stood up and went to the file cabinet in the corner. &#x201c;Step around the desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We&#x2019;ll look at the hotel floor plans.&#x201d;<br><br>He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plane of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of Ullman&#x2019;s cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the sounds of the Overlook Hotel&#x2019;s kitchen, gearing down from lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Top floor,&#x201d; Ullman said briskly. &#x201c;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don&#x2019;t want up in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don&#x2019;t believe it, not for a moment, but there mustn&#x2019;t even be that one-in-a-hundred chance that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his tongue.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you wouldn&#x2019;t allow your son up in the attic under any circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else?<br><br>Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile.<br><br>&#x201c;The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,&#x201d; he said in a scholarly voice. &#x201c;Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east wing. All of them command magnificent views.&#x201d;<br><br>Could you at least spare the salestalk?<br><br>But he kept quiet. He needed the job.<br><br>Ullman put the third floor on the bottom of the pile and they studied the second floor.<br>&#x201c;Forty rooms,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the extreme west end on the first. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now. Lobby level. Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk. Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only about the basement,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;For the winter caretaker, that&#x2019;s the most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room wall.&#x201d; He frowned impressively, perhaps to show that as manager, he did not concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook&#x2019;s operation as the boiler and the plumbing. &#x201c;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there too. Just a minute...&#x201d;<br><br>He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad disappeared back into Ullman&#x2019;s jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician&#x2019;s trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don&#x2019;t. This guy is a real heavyweight.<br><br>They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at Jack, a small, balding man in a banker&#x2019;s suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read simply STAFF&nbsp; in small gold letters.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has made his wishes in this caretaking matter quite obvious. He wants you hired. I will do so. But if I had been given a free hand in this matter, I would not have taken you on.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack&#x2019;s hands were clenched tightly in his lap, working against each other, sweating. Officious little prick, officious little prick, officious&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you care much for me, Mr. Torrance. I don&#x2019;t care. Certainly your feelings toward me play no part in my own belief that you are not right for the job. During the season that runs from May fifteenth to September thirtieth, the Overlook employs one hun- dred and ten people full-time; one for every room in the hotel, you might say. I don&#x2019;t think many of them like me and I suspect that some of them think I&#x2019;m a bit of a bastard. They would be correct in their judgment of my character. I have to be a bit of a bastard to run this hotel in the manner it deserves.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at Jack for comment, and Jack flashed the PR smile again, large and insultingly toothy.<br><br>Ullman said: &#x201c;The Overlook was built in the years 1907 to 1909. The closest town is Sidewinder, forty miles east of here over roads that are closed from sometime in late October or November until sometime in April. A man named Robert Townley Watson built it, the grandfather of our present maintenance man. Vanderbilts have stayed here, and Rockefellers, and Astors, and Du Ponts. Four Presidents have stayed in the Presidential Suite. Wilson, Harding, Roosevelt, and Nixon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be too proud of Harding and Nixon,&#x201d; Jack murmured.<br><br>Ullman frowned but went on regardless. &#x201c;It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and entrepreneur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the name,&#x201d; Jack said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold... except the Overlook. He funneled over a million dollars into it before the first postwar guest ever stepped through its doors, turning a decrepit relic into a show- place. It was Derwent who added the roque court I saw you admiring when you arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Roque? &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A British forebear of our croquet, Mr. Torrance. Croquet is bastardized roque. According to legend, Derwent learned the game from his social secretary and fell completely in love with it. Ours may be the finest roque court in America.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it,&#x201d; Jack said gravely. A roque court, a topiary full of hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggily game behind the equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see that Ullman wasn&#x2019;t done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of it. <br><br>&#x201c;When he had lost three million, Derwent sold it to a group of California investors. Their experience with the Overlook was equally bad. Just not hotel people.<br><br>&#x201c;In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years, but I&#x2019;m happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook&#x2019;s accounts were written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack supposed that this fussy little man&#x2019;s pride was justified, and then his original dislike washed over him again in a wave.<br><br>He said: &#x201c;I see no connection between the Overlook&#x2019;s admittedly colorful history and your feeling that I&#x2019;m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order to cope with the problem, I&#x2019;ve installed a full-time winter caretaker to run the boiler and to heat different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis. To repair breakage as it occurs and to do repairs, so the elements can&#x2019;t get a foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a slow, hot grin&#x2014;the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin&#x2014;stretch across his mouth. &#x201c;Is that it? I&#x2019;m surprised Al didn&#x2019;t tell you. I&#x2019;ve retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Shockley told me you no longer drink. He also told me about your last job... your last position of trust, shall we say? You were teaching English in a Vermont prep school. You lost your temper, I don&#x2019;t believe I need to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady&#x2019;s case has a bearing, and that is why I have brought the matter of your... uh, previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970&#x2013;71, after we had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a citizen&#x2019;s band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ullman said. &#x201c;The hotel does have a two-way radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then the place really isn&#x2019;t cut off.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#x201c;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut off then?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to Sidewinder in an hour and a half... maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue Service could get up here in three hours... under optimum conditions. In a blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn&#x2019;t hope to run a snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out into temperatures that might be twenty-five below&#x2014;or forty-five below, if you added in the wind chill factor.<br><br>&#x201c;In the case of Grady,&#x201d; Ullman said, &#x201c;I reasoned much as Mr. Shockley seems to have done in your case. Solitude can be damaging in itself. Better for the man to have his family with him. If there was trouble, I thought, the odds were very high that it would be something less urgent than a fractured skull or an accident with one of the power tools or some sort of convulsion. A serious case of the flu, pneumonia, a broken arm, even appendicitis. Any of those things would have left enough time.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?&#x201d; Ullman offered a patronizing little smile, ready to explain as soon as Jack admitted his ignorance, and Jack was happy to respond quickly and crisply.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme cases it can result in hallucinations and violence&#x2014;murder has been done over such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do the dishes.&#x201d;<br><br>Ullman looked rather nonplussed, which did Jack a world of good. He decided to press a little further, but silently promised Wendy he would stay cool.<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he hurt them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He murdered the little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way. His leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he fell downstairs.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Ageless Woman: Natural Health and Beauty After Forty with Maharishi Ayurveda</h2><p>Inspiring, informative, and empowering, The Ageless Woman* weaves timeless wisdom and the latest medical discoveries into a unique, highly-effective anti-aging guide for women.

Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>The Adventures of Tintin (also known as The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn[4] in the United Kingdom) is a 2011 American performance capture 3D film based on The Adventures of Tintin, a series of comic books created by Belgian artist Herg� (Georges Remi). Directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, and written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, the film is based on three of the original comic books: The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944).[5]<br>Spielberg first acquired rights to produce a film based upon the Adventures of Tintin series following Herg�'s death in 1983, and re-optioned them in 2002. Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but release was delayed to 2011 after Universal opted out of producing the film with Paramount, who provided $30 million on pre-production. Sony chose to co-produce the films. The delay resulted in Thomas Sangster, who had been cast as Tintin, departing from the project. Producer Peter Jackson, whose company Weta Digital is providing the computer animation, intends to direct a sequel. Spielberg and Jackson also hope to co-direct a third film.[6] --Wikipedia</p><h2>Re/Search #15: Incredibly Strange Music, Volume II</h2><p>Examines such overlooked works of music as Hawaiian music, sound-effects recordings, electronically synthesized music, and offbeat titles such as &#34;How to Strip for Your Husband,&#34; and &#34;Muhammad Ali Fights Tooth Decay&#34;</p><p>INCREDIBLY STRANGE MUSIC VOL.2 #15 <p>Incredibly Strange Music, Volume Two, continues the exploration of the territory spotlighted in Volume One: mostly out-of-print vinyl recordings from the '50s-'70s which do not fit into the already critically scrutinized genres of rock, jazz, and classical music. (See the introduction in Volume One, which need not be repeated here.) As in Volume One, we have included collectors who have remapped their own musical aesthetics (taking chances on records for a quarter or a dollar at garage sales and thrift stores). We also interview original artists responsible for some of the most unusual and imaginative recordings since the invention of the 12" LP: Bebe Barron, Juan Garcia Esquivel, Robert Moog, Ken Nordine, Korla Pandit, Yma Sumac, Elisabeth Waldo and Rusty Warren. </p><p>This is not a completist's volume: there are thousands of undocumented recordings which have yet to be unearthed and appreciated-many of which were produced and distributed only locally. A record may be worth owning if it has just one outstanding track, or perhaps just beautiful, provocative cover artwork (especially if it's cheap). A universe of unusual 45s awaits an encyclopedic overview, not to mention countless vinyl records from other countries.

Reprint.</p><p>15 1.5-hour cassettesTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy -- John le Carre's last tremendous success-ended with the devastating unmasking of a double agent at the heart of the British Secret Service (known as the Circus to le Carre's millions of readers round the world). Now, in The Honourable Schoolboy, George Smiley -- who has assumed the unenviable job of restoring the health, and reputation, of his demoralized organisation -- goes over to the attack. Salvaging what he can of the Service's ravaged network of spies, summoning back a few trustworthy old colleagues, working them -- and himself-around the clock, he searches for a whisper, a hint, a clue that will lead him back to his opposite number: Karla, the Soviet officer in Moscow Centre who masterminded the infamous treachery.<br><br>When he finds his opening, Smiley moves without hesitation. His battleground: the Far East. His choice of weapons: the Honourable Gerald (Jerry) Westerby, an Old Asia Hand, veteran of several marriages (and wars), unquestioning in his readiness to answer Smiley's summons. "You point me and I'll march," says Jerry.<br><br>Jerry's odyssey begins: to Hong Kong-and blackmail and murder; to collapsing Cambodia and Vietnam-and drug traffickers, the CIA, and a huge and mystifying "gold seam" spilling out of Russia. Slowly, manipulated by Smiley and his cohorts back in the Circus, Jerry thrusts himself into the centre of an intrigue of money, defection, passion -- and finds not only fertile ground for Smiley's revenge, but a drama of loyalty and love that both tests his courage and spurs his belated coming of age, in tragic defiance of the voracious requirements of the trice which owns his allegiance.<br><br>Here is John le Carre's richest, most accomplished work. Suspense, excitement, the techniques of espionage as only he has been able to make them real for us -- together with a Towing capacity for sustained action, a grandly conceived and intricately drawn plot, and profound observation of the Far Eastern landscape. The Honourable Schoolboy is both a supreme entertainment and a major novel.</p><h2>Vibrant Watercolours (Collins Artist&#x2019;s Studio)</h2><p><p>Shirley Trevena is well known for her vibrant use of colour.

Here Zuckerman meets Olga, and striking a deal with this strangely impressive woman is to bring home lessons for the successful American writer - lessons about oppression and resilience, laughter and Kafta, Jewishness and the unforeseen consequences of art.</p><p>In quest of the unpublished manuscript of a martyred Yiddish writer, the American novelist Nathan Zuckerman travels to Soviet-occupied Prague in the mid-1970s. There, in a nation straightjacketed by totalitarian Communism, he discovers a literary predicament, marked by institutionalized oppression, that is rather different from his own. He also discovers, among the oppressed writers with whom he quickly becomes embroiled in a series of bizarre and poignant adventures, an appealingly perverse kind of heroism. <br>The Prague Orgy, consisting of entries from protagonist Nathan Zuckerman's notebooks recording his sojourn among these outcast artists, completes the trilogy and epilogue "Zuckerman bound. It provides a startling ending to Roth's intricately designed magnum opus on the unforeseen consequences of art. <br>This Vintage edition is the first paperback publication of the epilogue."One of Roth's most brilliant (and funniest) works...a lithe comic masterpiece." &#x2014;<i>Newsweek</i><br><br>"Obscenely outrageous and yet brilliantly reflective of a paranoid reality that has become universal.

P. Clark commanded a detachment of Indian scouts&#x2014;including Pawnees, Shoshones, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, Crows, and Sioux&#x2014;who conversed in sign language. They made requests, relayed information, and told stories with their hands, communicating in a language indispensable for quick understanding between Indians of different tribes. The scouts patiently taught Clark the sign system, which he patiently recorded in this book. <p>Originally written in 1884 for use by the United States Army, The Indian Sign Language is far more than a grammar book or curiosity. Clark worked closely with the Indians who taught him the language, and his respect for them and their way of thinking informs every page. Written for future officers in Indian regions, The Indian Sign Language corrects the sentimental and brutal stereotypes of Indians that led to much misunderstanding.</p><p>Clark believed that sign language could assist him "to think like the Indians," which he considered essential for a conscientious officer. His book discusses reliably and soberly the facts of plains Indian life as he encountered them in the 1870s and 1880s. Now a classic, The <i>Indian Sign Language</i> is a monument to the desire for understanding between radically different peoples.</p><p></p></p><p>In 1876 and 1877, Captain W.P.

He's one unusual American with a whole lot to say about the things that vex us all: like Rice Krispies, funeral preaching, news that's unfit to print (or even think about for that matter), uncommon dawg tales, and the unavaoidable light at the end of the tunnel.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Lewis Grizzard, Jr., was an American writer and humorist known for his commentary on the American South. Although he spent his early career as a newspaper sportswriter and editor, becoming the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal at age 23, he was much better known for his humorous newspaper columns in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was also a popular stand-up comedian and lecturer."He is to Dixie what Royko is to Chicago, Breslin to New York, Buchwald to Washington. He's among the hottest things down South since corn bread." &#x2015;The Washington Post <br> "He has an enviable grasp on the pith and marrow of life.

They're better, though, off the shelf, because the inside are funnier than the covers." &#x2015;The Daily Oklahoman <br> "Lewis Grizzard thinks funny.

The case was Oscar Wilde's first trial, a libel action brought against the Marquess of Queensberry for publicly calling him a homosexual. What unfolded in the court was one of Victorian London's most infamous scandals: the great, doomed love affair between Wilde and Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas, the Marquess's son. When it became public, it cost Wilde everything.</p><p>Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson and a noted researcher and archivist, has discovered the original transcript of the trial that led to his grandfather's tragedy. Here for the first time is the true, uncensored record, free of the distortions and censorship of previous accounts.</p><p>On 18 February 1895, Bosie's father delivered a note to the Albemarle Club addressed to "Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite [sic]." With Bosie's encouragement, Wilde decided to sue the Marquess for libel. As soon as the trial opened, London's literary darling was at the center of the greatest scandal of his time.</p><p>Wilde's fall from grace was swift: having lost this case, he was in turn prosecuted and later imprisoned. Bankrupted, he fled to Paris never to see his family again. Within five years he was dead, his health never having recovered from the years in Reading gaol.</p><p>This remarkable book reveals Wilde on trial for his life, though he did not know it -- his confidence ebbing under the relentless cross-questioning, the wit for which he was so celebrated gradually deserting him under the remorseless scrutiny. The tragic climax falls when Wilde is betrayed by his own cleverness, unconsciously playing into the prosecutor's hands. With that his cause is lost.</p></p><p><p>Merlin Holland is Oscar Wilde's only grandson. He has been researching Wilde's life for the last twenty years. He is the coeditor of <em>The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde</em>.</p>In 1895, Oscar Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor for "committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons." Wilde's story became a cautionary tale for homosexuals in Victorian England; in the century since, he has come to be celebrated as a martyr of the gay struggle for recognition. This volume, with an introduction and commentary by Wilde's grandson, Holland, publishes for the first time the unabridged transcript of the first of the three infamous trials that resulted in Wilde's destruction. The irony, as Holland's introduction makes abundantly clear, is that Wilde courted his imprisonment, suing his inamorata's father, the Marquess Queensberry, John Douglass, for libel when Queensberry left a card for him at the Albemarle Club that read, "For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite." Wilde might have been best served by tearing up the card and forgetting it; instead, he pressed charges. But Wilde's riskiest step was treating the witness stand as a theatrical stage. When a prosecutor asked him if he had kissed a certain young man, Wilde joked, "Oh no, never in my life. He was a peculiarly plain boy." With that one flippant comment, Holland's text suggests, the die was cast. But the transcript and Holland's judicious notes also reveal how ill-served Wilde was by his counsel. Some of the same letters that were later used to convict Wilde were introduced by his own lawyers in this first trial as evidence. The general reader might find a work that condenses all three trial transcripts into one narrative, such as Moises Kaufman's stage adaptation, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, more accessible, but this volume is invaluable for the Wilde enthusiast, the legal scholar, the champion of human rights and the student of English literature. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Halo: Glasslands</h2><p><p>The Covenant has collapsed after a long, brutal war that saw billions slaughtered on Earth and her colonies.

Its arms flailed as if it was on some passionate Sangheili rant about politics or religion or whatever they played instead of football, its cloverleaf jaws snapping open and shut like a demented gin-trap. Osman watched from the shuttle cargo bay with her rifle resting on the control panel. Matters could get out of hand with a two-and-a-half-meter alien before you knew it. She was ready to drop the thing before it crushed Phillips. <br>He could actually speak their language, even if some of the sounds defied simple human jaws. She wondered what he sounded like to them. He was making mirroring gestures back at the Sangheili, and although she couldn&#x2019;t hear the conversation it seemed to be working. The alien did that odd trick with its split mandibles, pressing the two sides together to mimic a human jaw and trying to force out more articulate sounds. <br>So the hinge-head was mirroring too. It was a good sign.&nbsp; <i>A good sign in a bad deal.</i>&nbsp;No, not a bad deal: a dirty one. Osman stepped down from the bay, careful to keep her rifle close to her leg so she looked prepared but not threatening. Phillips glanced over his shoulder at her, seeming oblivious of the risk. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d never take my eyes off that thing. God, what do they teach these academics about personal safety?</i> <br>She leaned against the hatch frame and waited, glancing at her watch to check Sydney time. Around her, the ruins of New Llanelli felt like a rebuke. The dead tapped her on the shoulder, appalled:&nbsp; <i>And you&#x2019;re talking to these bastards now? On our graves?</i> <br>A shaft of sunlight struck through a break in the clouds and threw up a bright reflection from a lake in the distance.&nbsp; <i>No&nbsp;&#x2026; that&#x2019;s not a lake.</i>&nbsp;Her brain had joined up the dots and made the wrong assumption. She eased her datapad out of her jacket pocket one-handed and checked. There was no body of water for a hundred kilometers on the map in the CAA Factbook. The reflective surface was vitrified sandy soil, mirror-smooth, square hectares of it where there had once been rye and potatoes. <br>When the Covenant glassed a planet, they really did just that. <br>Phillips gestured to get her attention and distracted her from the uncomfortable thought that the planet was making a point to her. He walked over to the shuttle, looking pleased with himself. <br>&#x201c;The Bishop wants a word,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I told him you were the boss woman. His English is pretty good, so play it straight. And don&#x2019;t call him an Elite. Use the proper name. It matters to them.&#x201d; <br>Osman pushed herself away from the bulkhead with her hip. &#x201c;What, like&nbsp; <i>bishop</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ignore that.&#x201d; Phillips&#x2014;Professor Evan Phillips, another respectable academic who&#x2019;d been sucked down into ONI&#x2019;s drain&#x2014;put on his serious face again. &#x201c;They told me he was devout, but I didn&#x2019;t realize&nbsp; <i>how</i>&nbsp;devout.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is that going to be a problem?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Might be a bonus.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, they do tend to stick to a plan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant that he&#x2019;s a fundamentalist. The Abiding Truth. Very,&nbsp; <i>very</i>&nbsp;old tradition of faith.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Prompt me. I&#x2019;m not an anthropologist.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re said to have squirreled away original Forerunner relics from the time of their first contact. Their equivalent of saints&#x2019; fingers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It must be my birthday.&#x201d; Osman wasn&#x2019;t sure when that really was. Today seemed as good a day as any. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ve got some schematics in a dusty drawer or something.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, don&#x2019;t keep him waiting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How is he with women? I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen a female Sangheili. Do they keep them in purdah or something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that simple.&#x201d; Phillips beckoned to her to follow. &#x201c;The ladies wield a hell of a lot of political power in the bloodline stakes. When you&#x2019;ve got a few hours to kill, I&#x2019;ll explain it.&#x201d; <br>She didn&#x2019;t, and it could wait. She walked up to the Sangheili, steeling herself not to call him an Elite or a murdering hinge-head bastard. <br>Osman was taller than the average man, and at one-ninety she wasn&#x2019;t used to having to look up at anybody. But the Bishop towered half a meter above her like a monument in gold armor. For a moment she found herself looking into a disturbingly featureless face before she settled on the black eyes and small, flaring nostrils just below them. The Bishop was sniffing her scent. Unsettling didn&#x2019;t even begin to cover it. <br>&#x201c;Captain Osman,&#x201d; Phillips said cautiously, looking back and forth between her and the Sangheili. &#x201c;Let me introduce you to Avu Med &#x2018;Telcam, speaker for the Servants of Abiding Truth. He used to be a field master but he&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; renounced the ways of the infidels and cleansed his name, because they&#x2019;ve brought shame and misery on the Sangheili&nbsp;&#x2026; and they deserve to hang from spikes.&#x201d; He seemed to be quoting very carefully, glancing at the Sangheili as if for confirmation. He gave her a don&#x2019;t-say-anything-daft look. &#x201c;He means the Arbiter.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam sniffed again. Osman could smell him, too. It was a faintly leathery scent, like the seats of a new car. It wasn&#x2019;t unpleasant. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Captain Osman. I&#x2019;m a shipmaster.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam would get the point. &#x201c;So I keep my word. May we talk?&#x201d; She gave Phillips her get-lost look. This wasn&#x2019;t for his ears, and that was as much for his own good as Earth&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Can you give us ten minutes, Professor?&#x201d; <br>Phillips nodded and turned to walk away. This was why Osman didn&#x2019;t like using co-opted specialists. If he&#x2019;d known what she was about to do, he would probably have gone all ethical on her. <br> <i>I might be underestimating him, of course. But his job&#x2019;s done. It&#x2019;s not his problem now.</i> <br>&#x2018;Telcam tilted his head to one side. Osman had to strain to make out the words, but it was no harder than concentrating on a bad radio signal. The creature really could speak pretty good English. <br>&#x201c;Shipmaster, my people have been punished because they had no&nbsp; <i>faith,</i>&#x201d; he said. A fine mist of saliva cooled on her face every time he hit a sibilant or an&nbsp; <i>F</i>. It didn&#x2019;t look easy to articulate those four-way jaws. &#x201c;The traitor Thel &#x2018;Vadam and his ilk now say the gods are deceivers, and so they shall die. We have been in thrall to mongrel races long enough. We have let the false prophets of the San&#x2019;Shyuum corrupt our pure connection to the divine. Now we shall do our penance and bring the Sangheili back to the true path. So what can you possibly want with us? Do you want to agree to a truce?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How were you planning on killing &#x2018;Vadam and the other&nbsp;&#x2026; traitors?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We have few ships left now. Few weapons, too. But we have our devotion. We will find a way.&#x201d; <br>Osman noted the energy sword on his belt.&nbsp; <i>We&#x2019;ve got a right one here. A god-bothering, heavily armed maniac. Lovely. I can do business with that.</i>&nbsp;She tried to find genuine common ground in case he could smell fear or deceit on her. A small dash of truth in a soup of lies worked wonders. <br>&#x201c;What if&nbsp; <i>we</i>&nbsp;supplied you with some weapons?&#x201d; <br>He jerked his head back. &#x201c;And why would you do that? The traitor sides with humans against his own.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Humans gamble. I&#x2019;m betting that your side will win. Dead friends aren&#x2019;t much use.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam made a little sound like a horse puffing through its lips. A fine spray rained on her again and she tried not to recoil. She picked up a whiff of something far too much like dog food. &#x201c; <i>Kingmaker.</i>&nbsp;This is your policy. You help us take control so that you know your enemy and think you can then control&nbsp; <i>us.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;re never going to be friends, Field Master. But we can agree to stay out of one another&#x2019;s way and lead separate existences. Too many lives have been lost. It has to stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x2018;Telcam leaned closer again as if he was doing a uniform inspection. &#x201c;You have colonies here. This is part of the war. This is the cause of our enmity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of our colonies don&#x2019;t like us very much either. Humans kill humans too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How tangled your lives are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My, you&nbsp; <i>do</i>&nbsp;speak good English.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was a translator once. I interpreted your communications for my old shipmaster. I speak several human languages.&#x201d; <br>Well, that explained a hell of a lot. Phillips obviously didn&#x2019;t know, or at least he hadn&#x2019;t said, but Osman decided to cut him some slack because he&#x2019;d only been tasked to do one thing: to get her an audience with dissident Sangheili who were likely to disrupt any peace deals. He was lucky to get that far without having his head ripped off. <br>&#x201c;Well, Field Master, I think we can help one another keep our troublesome factions in line.&#x201d; Osman turned slightly to keep Phillips in her peripheral vision, just in case he wandered back and heard too much. &#x201c;It might require some discretion, because we can&#x2019;t be seen to ally with you. But an unstable Sangheili empire doesn&#x2019;t help us, and an unstable human one is a threat to you. Yes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And some of my brethren might not understand my willingness to talk to infidels. So we do favors, you and I.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed. For the greater good.&#x201d; Osman paused a beat and made sure she didn&#x2019;t blink. Sangheili had a military sense of honor, and the truth she was about to drop into the deceit went some way toward satisfying her own. &#x201c;If I thought &#x2018;Vadam would survive as leader, I would be doing deals with him instead.&#x201d; <br>She wasn&#x2019;t sure if Sangheili ever smiled. If they did, she had no idea what it looked like, not with that four-way jaw. But &#x2018;Telcam&#x2019;s expression shifted a little. The muscles in his dog-reptile face relaxed for a moment. <br>&#x201c;I have a condition,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I thought you might.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You blaspheme about the gods. You spread vile lies about them. This must stop.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We just showed you what the Halo was.&#x201d;&nbsp; <i>Oh shit. Come on, think. There&#x2019;s a way through this.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t set out to insult your beliefs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So the Halos are machines of destruction. So you say the gods themselves were killed by them.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam leaned over her, almost nose to nose. He was so close that she couldn&#x2019;t focus on those doglike teeth. They were just cream blurs in a purplish haze of gum. &#x201c; <i>Your</i>&nbsp;god chose to die for you and that is precisely why you revere him, yes? And why you say he also&nbsp; <i>lives.</i>&nbsp;This so-called proof about the Halos means nothing. Not even to&nbsp; <i>you.</i>&#x201d; <br> <i>And he uses the plural. Halos.</i> <br>Osman suspected that he wanted her to agree with him, to reassure him that gods could be both dead and eternal at the same time like some divine Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat, to put some certainty back in his life. She knew that feeling. But the last thing she wanted was a theological argument with a heavily armed alien four or five times her weight. She bit back a comment that her name was Osman and that he was thinking of someone else&#x2019;s religion. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had scientists who claim they&#x2019;ve disproved the existence of God, and others who argue you can&#x2019;t prove anything,&#x201d; she said carefully. &#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t made any difference to any of our religions. Faith is quite separate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then you understand.&#x201d; &#x2018;Telcam drew back. &#x201c;If you arm us&nbsp;&#x2026; if you stay away from our worlds&nbsp;&#x2026; then when we take power and restore the rightful ways, we will leave you alone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Deal,&#x201d; she said. She almost held out her hand to shake on the agreement but thought better of it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch very soon.&#x201d; <br>The Sangheili just turned and loped away to his ship without another word. It was too easy to look at them and see only an ungainly animal with strangely bovine legs, and not a superior force that had almost brought Earth to its knees. Phillips walked up to her but didn&#x2019;t ask what had happened. His expression said he was bursting to find out. <br>&#x201c;Are we done?&#x201d; <br>Osman nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one enemy we don&#x2019;t have to fight for a while.&#x201d; She gave him a thumbs-up. &#x201c;Well done. I never thought we&#x2019;d get one of them to talk to us, let alone reach an agreement. We owe you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I admit it&#x2019;s satisfying to be able to put the theory into practice. And wonderful to have unique access to Sangheili space with all expenses paid, of course. Good old ONI. My taxes, well spent.&#x201d; <br>Osman headed back to the shuttle, suddenly aware of small fragments of glass crunching under her boots.&nbsp; <i>Damn, that&#x2019;s not broken bottles. It&#x2019;s vitrification.</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t feel your academic cred&#x2019;s been stained by mixing with us grubby little spooks, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God, no. I&#x2019;m not that naive. I know what you&#x2019;re up to. Just don&#x2019;t tell me, that&#x2019;s all. I have to be able to deny it with a straight face.&#x201d; <br>So he certainly wasn&#x2019;t stupid, and ONI wasn&#x2019;t doing anything that countless governments hadn&#x2019;t done over the centuries to look after their interests. She should have expected him to work it out. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re doing what, exactly?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, I thought I was helping you establish diplomatic channels with the hard-to-reach Sangheili demographic.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You told me not to tell you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, so I did.&#x201d; He winked at her. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve slapped a saddle on that tiger. Now you better make damn sure you don&#x2019;t fall off.&#x201d; <br>They settled into their seats and she ran the preflight checks before handing over to the AI. Phillips was whistling tunelessly under his breath, as if he was glad to be leaving. Osman had expected him to be reluctant to go home but he obviously had what he wanted&#x2014;some dazzling scientific paper, some award-worthy research, maybe even a lucrative book&#x2014;that nobody else in his field had, and that seemed to be enough. <br>He wouldn&#x2019;t be coming back here. He probably realized that. ONI regarded him as a single-use sharp. <br>&#x201c;Just remember that my enemy&#x2019;s enemy isn&#x2019;t my friend, Professor,&#x201d; she said, opening a secure comms channel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s my enemy who&#x2019;s just taking a sidebar.&#x201d; <br>Phillips burst out laughing. &#x201c;You sweet, innocent little flower. You&#x2019;ve never worked in academia, have you? Red in tooth and claw. Feuds, plots, vengeance. The works.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can imagine.&#x201d; The secure channel indicator flashed and Osman lowered her voice. &#x201c;Osman here, ma&#x2019;am. Professor Phillips and I are on our way back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you for letting me know, Captain.&#x201d; Admiral Margaret Parangosky, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence, never raised her voice and never needed to. &#x201c;I assume things went well.&#x201d; <br>Osman could translate Parangosky-isms easily enough.&nbsp; <i>Have you set up the Sangheili insurrection?</i>&nbsp;That was what she meant. Few outside the Navy and the senior ranks of government knew who Parangosky was, let alone knew to fear her. Osman suspected she was the only person in the Admiral&#x2019;s circle who would always be forgiven even if she failed. But she wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to test it. <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Thank Professor Phillips for me. Safe flight.&#x201d; <br>Osman signed off and the AI took over. The shuttle shuddered on its dampers as its engines reached peak power. In a few hours, they&#x2019;d rendezvous with&nbsp; <i>Battle of Minden</i>&nbsp;and head back to Earth, where the mission would be over for Phillips but only just beginning for her. <br> <i>So far, so good.</i> <br>&#x201c;Do I get a gold star?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;Maybe an extra cookie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the best Turkish restaur...</p><h2>Mary Higgins Clark: Three Complete Novels: Where Are The Children; A Stranger Is Watching; The Cradle Will Fall</h2><p>From the biggest, bestselling author writing today, queen of suspense and riveting terror, three bone-chilling novels.

Many find that drawing close to nature allows them to access different levels of energy and awareness, which can bring deeper meaning and spiritual satisfaction. Trees can function as a gateway to these different levels of being as they provide us with a better understanding of ourselves and our ancestors. A walk in the woods makes it easy to understand the awe and reverence our ancestors had for trees. However, the human-tree relationship had its beginnings long before people trod upon the earth.</p> <p>Millions of years ago, trees evolved into giants of the planet, and became the most successful form of plant life in the competition for sunlight and other resources. While they created advantages for themselves, they were also steadfast providers for certain members of the animal kingdom. Small creatures sought protection from predators in the aerial arms of trees, and finding a convenient bounty of food aloft, they stayed and made their homes among the welcoming branches.</p> <p>Establishing a symbiotic association with the trees, these creatures provided additional means for dispersing pollen and seeds. Some of these animals, classified as prosimians, developed their distinctive characteristics, such as both eyes in the front of the head, and evolved into the simians that eventually came down from the trees. Darwin explained the rest.</p> <p>With these prosimians in mind, it could be said that if it were not for the trees we would not be here. Biologically speaking, it can also be said that we could not remain here if it weren't for the trees, as they are largely responsible for creating and maintaining Earth's atmosphere.</p> <p>It was the "big blue marble" view of Earth and its atmosphere that sparked scientist James Lovelock's Gaia theory (Earth as a living, self-regulating entity). Lovelock said that when he saw pictures of Earth taken from outer space, he had an epiphany of the atmosphere burning like a blue flame.1 He realized how crucial the cycles of the elements were for life, and how humans are part of the environment, not separate from it. As we breathe, we take oxygen into our bodies and it becomes part of us. Trees produce the oxygen we take in. We breathe out carbon dioxide and trees take that in. Because of this basic biology, we still have a symbiotic association with the trees. However, a great deal has transpired in this relationship since the time of the prosimians.</p> <p>Biology aside, our civilization could not have developed without trees. After humans first attached sharpened stones to the ends of sticks to extend their reach as hunters, and kindled fires for warmth and cooking, there was no going back, because trees had taken on a new importance in human life. Providing the basics was just the beginning. The more we learned to use our brains and make plans, the more we relied on trees for shelter, furniture, and tools for almost everything. Wood for wagons, ships, and bridges to get us from here to there allowed people to spread out and travel farther. We humans also developed the peculiar activities of writing and music, which relied on wood-and the forests continued to fall under the axe.</p> <p>Long before this great rush to consume wood, people viewed trees as something more than a source of food, shelter, and raw material. Perhaps it was the biological connection through breathing that allowed people to sense the spark of life that we hold in common with the trees. Trees became part of human spiritual and cultural traditions as well as one of the most powerful symbols that embody life. Trees served as vivid reminders of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and they seemed imbued with magic because they simultaneously dwelled in the three realms of heaven, earth, and underworld. Ancestors, other spirits, and even the Divine could be found amongst the trees of the woods. The forest was a place of beautiful mystery and deep transformation. People could sense the subtle energy that moved through the trees because it also moved through them. The connection between humans and the green world was real and central to everyday life, but somewhere along the way we lost this sense of connection.</p> <p>We lost our way through the woods and forgot that we, too, are part of the natural world. We continued to use more that the trees had to offer, such as gums, oils, rubber, turpentine, pitch, cork, as well as charcoal for smelting ore. Without trees, metal crafts could not have been developed. We continued to use more of everything, and the forests dwindled.</p> <p>Then came the so-called age of reason. Since the time of Newton, scientists viewed the world as a machine instead of a living system-trees were just fuel for man's engine. In the excitement of scientific discovery, reverence for nature was trampled. Religious leaders of the time were also caught up in the stampede to place humans above everything else. According to the church fathers, nature represented chaos and the wild, Pagan, female side of things that were classified as evil and beneath the dignity of "man." In their minds, nature had to be subdued and controlled. As technologies advanced, a false sense of power expanded, and the momentum that moved us farther from the natural world increased. Now, "virtual reality" separates us even more from the world that was once revered as sacred.</p> <p>While it seems that we have traded material wealth for spiritual poverty, quite possibly the pendulum has swung to its full extent and is now circling back. Greater numbers of people are openly turning to Paganism for spiritual fulfillment, and are consciously making everyday choices that are in line with their beliefs. Even the scientific community is beginning to acknowledge how incredibly complex and beautiful life on earth is, and some are bold enough to say that we humans are amateurs-even though we know a lot, we actually know very little.2 The gap between science and spirituality is not the chasm it once was. There is an acknowledgement of the wisdom that comes from within-within ourselves and within nature.</p> <p>As part of this change, Pagan and non-Pagan people are rediscovering the majesty of trees and are appreciating with wonder these magnificent giants. In the woods, you can't help but feel part of the natural world. With that feeling comes the self-realization of returning to Source, to the Divine. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki noted that the forest is helping people to realize that nature is not "out there" and separate. He said, "How you see the world is how you live in it."3 For Pagans this translates to intention and manifestation. We know that the integrity of our spiritual lives is intimately bound to the integrity of the natural world.</p> <p>Trees provide a gateway into a wider world of spirit and magic. This book is intended to help you explore your place in the "web of life"4 and its timeless mysteries. Trees provide multiple pathways to tap into this web for magical and spiritual purposes, as well as to simply embrace and enhance life. Like music, trees speak to something deep and primal within us. They can help us open our souls to the power and spirit of Earth's rhythms. They can help us harvest the fruit of our spiritual journey and find the seeds of our future.</p> <p>1 David Suzuki, The Sacred Balance. A four-part video series.

Jonathan and his wife live in Graton, California.Frosty, midnight blues accompany a rhythmic, onomatopoeic text to evoke a ride aboard a night train. A sleepbound boy muses about such a journey, "through a forest / in the dark / under the stars." With spare elegance, London celebrates both the beauty of nighttime ("the snow flutters / like white butterflies / in the steam / and in the beam / of light / from the locomotive") and the power of the train ("it ticktacks / down the tracks / and snakes through a tunnel / blacker than night"). Likewise, Rand's ( Night Tree ) luminous paintings capture the watchful activity of nocturnal creatures across a snowy landscape bisected by the chugging engine. He combines ground chalk, india ink and watercolors to achieve a remarkable range of textures and densities, from the owl's feathers to the glittering snow.

At various times in the past, Shermer has believed in fundamentalist Christianity, alien abductions, Ayn Rand, megavitamin therapy, and deep-tissue massage. Now he believes in skepticism, and his motto is "<i>Cognite tute</i>--think for yourself." This updated edition of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> covers Holocaust denial and creationism in considerable detail, and has chapters on abductions, Satanism, Afrocentrism, near-death experiences, Randian positivism, and psychics. Shermer has five basic answers to the implied question in his title: for consolation, for immediate gratification, for simplicity, for moral meaning, and because hope springs eternal. He shows the kinds of errors in thinking that lead people to believe weird (that is, unsubstantiated) things, especially the built-in human need to see patterns, even where there is no pattern to be seen. Throughout, Shermer emphasizes that skepticism (in his sense) does not need to be cynicism: "Rationality tied to moral decency is the most powerful joint instrument for good that our planet has ever known." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior.

Professor Edwin Redslob is more than old; he is ancient, a survivor of almost a century of violence. He was already in his mid-thirties when Germany's broken armies came straggling home from the First World War, and now he is eighty-six, tall and smiling and white-haired. He can hardly see through the thick lenses that fortify his eyes, but he totters across his dusk-darkened studio, past the window that opens onto the white-blossoming apple trees in the garden, and then he bends over a wooden cabinet that contains his treasures.</p><p>As an art expert, he joined the Interior Ministry more than fifty years ago to help the nascent Weimar government create a new image for the new Germany, and he began by commissioning a young Expressionist painter named Karl Schmidt-Rotluff to redesign the most fundamental image, the German eagle. Now he bends over a shallow drawer, grunts and fumbles through a sheaf of pictures, and finally pulls forth the one he wants: the Weimar eagle. He holds it high, gazing at it with affection. The eagle boasts all the pride and dignity of its imperial ancestors, black wings spread wide, beak hungrily open, but it has other qualities as well. It seems less grim than the traditional eagle; indeed, it seems almost cheerful, a friendly eagle. "A marvelous thing," says Dr. Redslob. "But the number of insults that this picture provoked--you wouldn't believe it."</p><p>It is a mistake, perhaps, to attach too much importance to symbols. In the Berlin Zoo, there is a real eagle--two of them, in fact--and we can stand outside the cage and regard the imprisoned beast that we consider the German symbol, and our own. At the base of an artificial tree, there lies a pool of rather dirty water, and one of the eagles slowly lowers its claw-feet into the pool and begins picking at the bloody carcass of a rabbit that has been left there to satisfy its appetite for carrion.</p><p>In the tranquillity of the Zoo, there are cages for every variety of giant bird-huge hawks wheeling restlessly within the limits of their confinement, flamingos folding and unfolding themselves, and even some mournful marabous, which stand in stoic silence and stare back at their visitors. Wandering loose in the Zoo, ignoring the elephants and the rhinoceroses, there are dozens of mallards, always two by two, the green-headed male trailed by his speckled brown and white mate. Nor do they remain in the Zoo. They float among the swans in the canals outside the Charlottenburg Palace. They roam among the chestnut trees in the Tiergarten. They nibble at weeds in the Havel River. "You don't have ducks like that in American cities?" a Berliner asks in surprise. "Here they are everywhere."</p><p>Berlin, more than almost any other great city, is a city of birds. One hears not only sparrows chirping in the midst of the traffic on the Kurfurstendamm but wood thrushes singing in the Glienicker Park. One sees species one never expects to find in cities-magpies and nightingales and a black-feathered, yellow-beaked diving grebe known as a "water chicken." Even at the Hilton Hotel, the traveling businessman wakes to the sound of peacocks screeching in the night.</p><p>One reason for this variety of birds is that Berlin has always been what jean Giraudoux called "no city of gardens [but] a garden itself." Though it is still the largest metropolis between Paris and Moscow, it also has 835 farms, and almost 200 waterways, and more than half of its land is devoted to parks, forests, and gardens. There are wild boars roaming in the woods of Berlin, and herds of deer, and there are flocks of sheep grazing on the outer runways of Tempelhof airport. The air is clear and cool, a little sharp.</p><p>Another reason for the birds of Berlin is that the Berliners care for them, feed them and watch over them. In the southern district of Lichterfelde, in the shadow of a gigantic white research hospital that has been heavily financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, a pink-cheeked old gentleman welcomes a visitor by leading the way out into the back yard so that one can watch him take a shovelful of sunflower seeds from a metal box and spray it on the lawn. One of the green-headed mallards rushes forward to snap up the seeds, and the old man points to a linden tree where a dozen long-tailed doves sit cooing in anticipation. "Turkish doves," he says. "They come from the Himalayas, and they always stop here for their food."</p><p>The birds represent, generation after generation, a kind of permanence in a city that has never known the century-old traditions of a Paris or a London. Born in the thirteenth century in the mud and swamps at the junction of the Spree and Havel rivers, Berlin remained a minor crossroads during the grand reigns of Venice and Amsterdam and even, for that matter, Hamburg. As late as 1860, Henry Adams described it as "a poor, keen-witted provincial town, simple, dirty, uncivilized, and in most respects disgusting." Only in the latter part of the nineteenth century, with industrialization and the coming of the railroads, and then the political triumphs of Bismarck, did Berlin grow into the great metropolis of Central Europe (its population, which was 198,ooo in 1815, soared to 826,000 by the time the Empire was founded in 1871, and to 2,529,000 in 1900).</p></p><h2>Here If You Need Me: A True Story</h2><p>Ten years ago, Kate Braestrup and her husband Drew were enjoying the life they shared together. They had four young children, and Drew, a Maine state trooper, would soon begin training to become a minister as well. Then early one morning Drew left for work and everything changed. On the very roads that he protected every day, an oncoming driver lost control, and Kate lost her husband.<br> Stunned and grieving, Kate decided to continue her husband's dream and became a minister herself. And in that capacity she found a most unusual mission: serving as the minister on search and rescue missions in the Maine woods, giving comfort to people whose loved ones are missing, and to the wardens who sometimes have to deal with awful outcomes. Whether she is with the parents of a 6-year-old girl who had wandered into the woods, with wardens as they search for a snowmobile rider trapped under the ice, or assisting a man whose sister left an infant seat and a suicide note in her car by the side of the road, Braestrup provides solace, understanding, and spiritual guidance when it's needed most.<br> HERE IF YOU NEED ME is the story of Kate Braestrup's remarkable journey from grief to faith to happiness. It is dramatic, funny, deeply moving, and simply unforgettable, an uplifting account about finding God through helping others, and the tale of the small miracles that occur every day when life and love are restored.</p><p>Braestrup&#39;s novel Onion was published by Viking in 1990, and she has since published a series of magazine articles in Mademoiselle, Ms., City Paper, Hope and Law and Order. She lives in Maine.This true story, which begins with a death, will make you laugh as well as cry and will certainly leave you uplifted. Briefly, when Braestrups husband, Drew, a Maine State Trooper, is killed in a car accident, Braestrup decides to pursue her husbands dream of becoming a Maine Warden Service chaplin. The subsequent story interweaves anecdotes of her Warden Service ministry with reflections on how she and her four young children coped and ultimately triumphed. Braestrup reads in an unexpectedly childlike voice. Her phrasing and pacing are perfect, though, so one soon forgets the almost saccharine voice and concentrates on the beautiful writing and funny, moving story. A.C.S. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Court and Garden: From the French H�tel to the City of Modern Architecture (Graham Foundation / MIT Press Series in Contemporary Architectural Discourse)</h2><p>The "tyranny of the private realm" is destroying our cities. Modern architecture, with its insistence on the mute object and its rejection of the conventions of street and square, has abdicated civic responsibility and eschewed the urban forms that express and promote it. In this eloquent and extensively illustrated study of the evolution of a modern conception of space, Michael Dennis explores the social, psychological, and especially the formal transformations that that led architects to trade the city of public space for a city of private icons. The French <i>h�tel,</i> an aristocratic town house developed largely in Paris between 1550 and 1800, is a sophisticated instrument of urbanism that both chronicles the demise of the public realm and offers architectural techniques for reconstructing a spatially rich city. In its development from Italianate prototypes to an urban courtyard building and finally to a freestanding pavilion in a private garden, the French <i>h�tel</i> illustrates the transformation of the city from one of platonic voids to one of platonic solids, from one of buildings that define space to one of buildings that treat space as merely left over.<br> <br> In reconstructing the origins of the modern city&#x2014;and the modern sense of privacy&#x2014;Dennis focuses on the plan of the <i>h�tel</i> and on the relationship between the external and internal organization of buildings. He identifies three distinct <i>h�tel</i> types&#x2014;Baroque, Roccoco, and Neoclassical&#x2014;and examines the urban and social changes reflected in their sitings and facades and in such details as the sequence of public and private rooms, patterns of circulation, and the proliferation of rooms with special functions.<br> <br> By studying the plans, Dennis asserts, modern architects can recapture the language of urbanism and learn how to reconcile modern and traditional modes of building organization and spatial development. The extensive documentation he provides&#x2014;nearly 400 illustrations, including historical maps of Paris, <i>h�tel</i> plans, and photographs of extant <i>h�tels</i>&#x2014;encourages that study and significantly extends the tradition of illustrated architectural treatises by Marot (c. 1670), Blondell (1752-1756) and Krafft (c. 1802), establishing this book as the definitive scholarly work on the French <i>h�tel.</i><br> <br> A Graham Foundation Book.</p><p>Michael Dennis is a practicing architect. He has taught and lectured widely, and was the 1986 Thomas Jefferson Professor of Architecture at the University of Virginia.This is a specialized account of architecture in the modern period (since 1750) by a practicing architect and professor of architecture at Harvard. Dennis's text is aimed at the architectural community and deeply indebted to the pioneering work of Colin Rowe. It makes a valuable contribution to the history of French architecture, delivering primarily a thoughtful review of the development of the French hotel (roughly translatable as townhouse), the best history of this house type in English, which then serves as entree to discussion of modern urbanism derived from the theories of Le Corbusier. Profusely illustrated and soundly researched, but of interest primarily to architects and architectural historians. Peter Kaufman, Suffolk Community Coll.

She lives outside Atlanta with her husband, just a short distance from her two sons and grandchildren.<i>Pr o l o g u e<br></i>Mama, can you tell me yet?&#x201d; Cara held her favorite toy, stroking the small plastic horse as if it might respond to her tender touch. The brown ridges, designed to look like fur, had long ago faded to tan.<br>Mama held the well-worn steering wheel in silence while she drove dirt roads Cara had never seen before. Dust flew in through the open windows and clung to Cara&#x2019;s sweaty face, and the vinyl seat was hot to the touch when she laid her hand against it. Mama pressed the brake pedal, slowing the car to a near stop as they crossed another bridge with a roof over it. A covered bridge, Mama called it. The bumpiness of the wooden planks jarred Cara, making her bounce like she was riding a cardboard box down a set of stairs.<br>Mama reached across the car seat and ran her hand down the back of Cara&#x2019;s head, probably trying to smooth out one of her cowlicks. No matter how short Mama cut her hair, she always said the unruly mop won the battle. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to visit a...a friend of mine. She&#x2019;s Amish.&#x201d;<br>She placed her index finger on her lips. &#x201c;I need you to do as the mother of Jesus did when it came to precious events. She treasured them in her heart and pondered them. You&#x2019;ve grown so much since you turned<br>eight, and you&#x2019;re a big girl, but you can&#x2019;t draw pictures or write words about it in your diary, and you can&#x2019;t ever tell your father, okay?&#x201d;<br>Sunlight bore down on them again as they drove out of the covered bridge. Cara searched the fields for horses. &#x201c;Are we going to your hiding place?&#x201d;<br>Cara had a hiding place, one her mother had built for her inside the wall of the attic.They had tea parties in there sometimes when there was money for tea bags and sugar. And when Daddy needed quiet, her mother would silently whisk her to that secret room. If her mama didn&#x2019;t return for her by nightfall, she&#x2019;d sleep in there.<br>Mama nodded. &#x201c;I told you every girl needs a fun place she can get away to for a while, right?&#x201d;<br>Cara nodded.<br>&#x201c;Well, this is mine. We&#x2019;ll stay for a couple of days, and if you like it, maybe we&#x2019;ll move here one day&#x2014;just us girls.&#x201d;<br>Cara wondered if Mama was so tired of the bill collectors hounding her and Daddy that she was thinking of sneaking away and not even telling him where she was going. The familiar feeling returned&#x2014;that feeling of her insides being Jell-O on a whirlybird ride. She clutched her toy horse even tighter and looked out the window, imagining herself on a stallion galloping into a world where food was free and her parents were happy.<br>After they topped another hill, her mother slowed the vehicle and pulled into a driveway. Mama turned off the car. &#x201c;Look at this place, Cara. That old white clapboard house has looked the same since I used to come here with my mama.&#x201d;<br>The shutters hung crooked and didn&#x2019;t have much paint left on them. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really small, and the shutters make it look like ghosts live here.&#x201d;<br>Her mama laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called a <i>Daadi Haus, </i>which means it&#x2019;s just for grandparents once their children are grown. They only need a small kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. This one has been here for many years. <br>You&#x2019;re right&#x2014;the shutters do make it look dilapidated. Come on.&#x201d;<br>Seconds after Cara pushed the passenger door shut, an old woman stepped out from between tall rows of corn. She stared at them as if they were aliens, and Cara wondered if her mama really did know these people.<br>The woman wore a long burgundy dress and no shoes. The wrinkles covering her face looked like a roadmap. The lines took on new twists as she frowned. Though it was July and too hot for a toboggan cap, she had on a black one anyway.<br><i>&#x201c;Grossmammi Levina, Ich bin kumme bsuche. Ich hab aa die Cara mitgebrocht.&#x201d;<br></i>Startled, Cara looked up at her mama.What language did she just speak? Mama wasn&#x2019;t even good at pig Latin.<br>The old woman released her apron, and several ears of corn fell to the ground. She hurried up to Mama. &#x201c;Yvonne?&#x201d;<br>Tears brimmed in Mama&#x2019;s eyes, and she nodded. The older woman squealed, long and loud, before she hugged Mama.<br>A lanky boy came running from the rows. &#x201c;Levina, <i>was iss letz</i>?&#x201d; He stopped short, watching the two women for a moment before looking at Cara.<br>As he studied her, she wondered if she looked as odd to him as he did to her. She hadn&#x2019;t seen a boy in long black pants since winter ended, and she&#x2019;d never seen one wear suspenders and a straw hat.Why would he work a garden in a Sunday dress shirt?<br>He snatched up the ears of corn the woman had dropped, walked to a wooden wheelbarrow, and dumped them. Cara picked up the rest of the ears and followed him. &#x201c;You got a name?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ephraim.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can be lots of help if you&#x2019;ll let me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ya ever picked corn before?&#x201d;<br>Cara shook her head. &#x201c;No, but I can learn.&#x201d;<br>He just stood there, watching her.<br>She held out her horse to him. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she a beauty?&#x201d;<br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Looks a little worn to me.&#x201d;<br>Cara slid the horse into her pocket.<br>Ephraim frowned. &#x201c;Can I ask you a question?&#x201d;<br>She nodded.<br>&#x201c;Are you a boy or a girl?&#x201d;<br>The question didn&#x2019;t bother her. She got it all the time at school from new teachers or ones who didn&#x2019;t have her in their classes. They referred to her as a young man until they realized she wasn&#x2019;t a boy. She&#x2019;d learned to make it work for her, like the time she slipped right past the teacher who was the lavatory monitor and went into the boys&#x2019; bathroom to teach JakeMerrow a lesson about stealing her milk money. She got her money back, and he never told a soul that a girl gave him a fat lip. &#x201c;If I say I&#x2019;m a boy, will ya let me help pick corn?&#x201d;<br>Ephraim laughed in a friendly way. &#x201c;You know, I once had a worn horse like the one you showed me. I kept him in my pocket too, until I lost him.&#x201d;<br>Cara shoved the horse deeper into her pocket. &#x201c;You lost him?&#x201d;<br>He nodded. &#x201c;Probably down by the creek where I was fishing. Do you fish?&#x201d;<br>She shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a creek.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never seen one?Where are you from?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;New York City. My mama had to borrow a car for us to get beyond where the subway ends.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re here when the workday is done, I&#x2019;ll show you the creek. We got a rope swing, and if your mama will let you, you can swing out and drop into the deep part. How long are you here for?&#x201d;<br>She looked around the place. Her mama and the old woman were sitting under a shade tree, holding hands and talking. Across the road was a barn, and she could see a horse inside it. Green fields went clear to the horizon. She took a deep breath. The air smelled delicious, like dirt, but not city dirt. Like growing-food dirt.Maybe this was where her horse took her when she dreamed. The cornstalks reached for the sky, and her chest felt like little shoes were tap-dancing inside it. She should have known that if her mama liked something, it was worth liking.<br>&#x201c;A couple of days, I think.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Ch a p t e r 1<br>Twenty years later<br></i>Sunlight streamed through the bar&#x2019;s dirty windows as the lunch crowd filled the place. Cara set two bottles of beer on the table in front of the familiar faces. The regulars knew the rules: all alcoholic drinks were paid for<br>upon delivery.One of the men held a five-dollar bill toward her but kept his eyes on the television. The other took a long drink while he slid a hundred-dollar bill across the table.<br>She stared at the money, her heart pounding with desire.Mac kept most of the tip money the waitresses earned, and she&#x2019;d never been given anything larger than a twenty in her life. The money the customer slid across the table wasn&#x2019;t just cash but power. It held the ability to fix Lori something besides boiled potatoes for every meal next week.<br><i>Would he even notice if I short changed him from such a large amount?<br></i>Lines of honesty became blurry as the fight to remain hidden stole everything but mere existence. And her daughter.<br>Cara loathed that she couldn&#x2019;t apply for government help and that she had to uproot every few months to stay a few steps ahead of a maniac. Moving always cost money. Fresh security deposits on ever increasing rent. Working time lost as she searched for another job&#x2014; each one more pathetic than the one before it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get your change.&#x201d;<br><i>All of it. </i>She took the money.<br>&#x201c;Cara.&#x201d; Mac&#x2019;s gruff voice sailed across the room. From behind the bar, he motioned for her. &#x201c;Phone!&#x201d; He shook the receiver at her. &#x201c;Kendal says it&#x2019;s an emergency.&#x201d;<br>Every sound echoing inside the wood-and-glass room ceased. She hurried toward him, snaking around tables filled with people.<br>&#x201c;Keep it short.&#x201d;Mac passed the phone to her and returned to serving customers.<br>&#x201c;Kendal, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He found us.&#x201d; Her friend&#x2019;s usually icy voice shook, and Cara knew that she was more frightened than she&#x2019;d been the other times.<br><i>How could he after all they&#x2019;d done to hide? </i>&#x201c;We got a letter at our new place?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.Worse.&#x201d; Kendal&#x2019;s voice quaked. &#x201c;He was here. Broke the lock and came inside looking for you. He ransacked the place.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s getting bolder, Cara.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We have to call the police.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know we can&#x2019;t...&#x201d; Kendal dropped the sentence, and Cara heard her crying.<br>One of the waitresses plunked a tray of dirty dishes onto the counter. &#x201c;Get off the phone, princess.&#x201d;<br>Cara plugged her index finger into her ear, trying desperately to think. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Lori?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they moved her to after-school care.&#x201d; Through the phone line, Cara heard a car door slam. They didn&#x2019;t own a car.<br>A male voice asked, &#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br>Cara gripped the phone tighter. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br>Kendal sobbed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I can&#x2019;t take this anymore. All we do is live in fear and keep moving. He&#x2019;s...he&#x2019;s not after me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s trying to isolate me from everyone. Please, Kendal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I...I&#x2019;m sorry. I can&#x2019;t help you anymore,&#x201d; Kendal whispered. &#x201c;The<br>cab&#x2019;s waiting.&#x201d;<br>Disbelief settled over her. &#x201c;How long ago did he break in?&#x201d;<br>From behind Cara, a shadow fell across the bar, engulfing her. &#x201c;Hi, Care Bear.&#x201d;<br>She froze. Watching the silhouette, she noted how tiny she was in comparison.<br>Mike&#x2019;s thick hand and wrist thudded a book onto the bar beside her. She watched him remove his hand, revealing her diary. &#x201c;You left me no choice about busting into your place. I was looking for answers about why you keep running off.&#x201d;<br>She swallowed a wave of fear and faced him but couldn&#x2019;t find her voice.<br>&#x201c;Johnny&#x2019;s dead. Now you&#x2019;re here...with me. &#x201d; His massive body loomed over her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be willing to forget that you ever picked that loser. We could start fresh. Come on, beautiful, I can help you.&#x201d;<br><i>Help me?</i> The only person Mike wanted to help was himself&#x2014;right into her bed.<br>&#x201c;Please...leave me alone.&#x201d;<br>Silence fell in the midst of the bar&#x2019;s noise. Like fireworks shooting out in all directions, thoughts exploded in her mind. But before she could focus, they disappeared into the darkness, leaving only trails of smoke. Fear seemed to take on its own life form, one threatening to stalk her forever.<br>He tapped her diary. &#x201c;I know it all now, even where you&#x2019;d hide if you ran again&#x2014;which is <i>not </i>happening, right?&#x201d; The threatening tone in his voice was undeniable, and panic stole her next breath. &#x201c;I know your<br>daughter just as well as you do now.What happens if I show up one day after school with a puppy named Shamu?&#x201d;<br>Cara&#x2019;s legs gave way. Without any effort, he held her up by her elbow. After she&#x2019;d spent years of hide-and-seek in hopes of protecting Lori, now he knew Lori&#x2019;s name, her school, her likes and dislikes.<br>Shaking, he looked around for help. Various sizes and shapes of bottles filled the bar&#x2019;s shelves. The television blared. Blank faces stared at it. The man who had given her the hundred-dollar bill glanced at her before turning<br>to another waitress.<br>Apathy hung in the air, thicker than the cigarette smoke, reminding her that there was no help for people like her and Lori. On a good day there were distractions that made them forget for a few hours. Even as her mind whirled, life seemed to move in slow motion. She had no one.<br>&#x201c;You know how I feel about you.&#x201d; His voice softened to a possessive whisper, making her skin crawl. &#x201c;Why do you gotta make this so tough?&#x201d; Mike traced the long, jagged scar on the side of her neck. &#x201c;My patience is gone, Care Bear.&#x201d;<br>Where could she hide now? Somewhere she could afford that he wouldn&#x2019;t know about and couldn&#x2019;t track her to. A piece of a memory&#x2014; washed in colorless fog&#x2014;wavered before her like a sheet hung on the clothesline.<br>An apron. A head covering. An old woman. Rows of tall corn. He dug his fingers into her biceps. Pain shot through her, and the disjointed thoughts disappeared. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare leave again. I&#x2019;ll find you. You know I can...every time.&#x201d; His eyes reflected that familiar mixture of spitefulness and uncertainty as he willed her to do his bidding.<br>&#x201c;I call the shots. Not you. Not dear old Johnny. Me.&#x201d;<br>But maybe he didn&#x2019;t. A tender sprig of hope took root. If she could latch onto that memory&#x2014;if it was even <i>real</i>&#x2014;she might find a place to go. Somewhere Mike couldn&#x2019;t find her and she wouldn&#x2019;t owe the Johnnys of the world her life in exchange for food and shelter. Doubts rippled through her, trying to dislodge her newfound hope. It was probably amovie she&#x2019;d watched. Remembering any part of her life, anything true, before her mama died seemed as impossible as getting free of Mike. She&#x2019;d only been eight when hermother was killed by a hit-andrun driver as she crossed a street. Things became so hard after that, anything before seemed like shadows and blurs.<br>As she begged for answers, faint scenes appeared before her. A kitchen table spread with fresh foods. A warmbreeze streaming through an unfamiliar window. Sheets flapping on a clothesline.Muffled laughter as a boy jumped into a creek.<br>Was it just a daydream? Or was it somewhere she&#x2019;d once been, a place she couldn&#x2019;t reach because she couldn&#x2019;t remember?<br>Her heart raced. She had to find the answer.<br>Mike pulled the phone from her hand, a sneer overriding the insecurity he tried so hard to cover. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re more afraid of one thing than anything else. And I know what that is.&#x201d; He flipped the diary open and tapped his huge finger on a photo of Lori. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want nothing to cause the social workers to take her...&#x201d; He eased the receiver into its cradle. &#x201c;Think about it, Care Bear.&#x201d; He strode out the door.<br>Cara slumped against the counter. No matter how hard she tried, he landed in the same place over and over again&#x2014;in the clutches of a crazy man she knew from her days in foster care.<br>In spite of the absurdity of it, she longed for a cigarette. It would help her think and calm her nerves.<br>Clasped in her fist was the cash the two men had given for their drinks. She rubbed it between her fingers. If she slipped out the back door, no one at Mac&#x2019;s would have a clue where she went. She could pick up Lori and disappear.<br><br><i>Will Cara find the missing pieces to her past?When she discovers the secret her mother took to her grave, will it separate her from those who could help her?<br><br>Ephraim comes to realize who the stranger is that hides in the shadows during the day and sleeps in Levina&#x2019;s abandoned barn at night.When prejudices and fears cause the community to turn against Cara, will he risk losing every part of his Amish life to rescue her?</i></p><h2>The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman&#39;s Masterpiece</h2><p>Director Robert Altman&#39;s cult-film masterpiece Nashville is given its first ever behind-the-scenes viewing in this scrupulously researched book by Newsday and The Advocate film critic Jan Stuart. Written with the full cooperation of Altman, and including interviews with virtually everyone involved with the film, The Nashville Chronicles is a remarkable piece of reporting that explores both the creation of and the execution of a classic film. * * * When Nashville was first released in 1975, Robert Altman had already established himself as a film director with a unique vision and a natural ability to walk the fine line between the hyperreal and the surreal. A few years earlier, Altman had earned great acclaim -- and financial success -- through the brilliant and darkly comic film M*A*S*H, later to be turned into one of television&#39;s most enduring series. That wildly successful movie was followed by a series of quirky films, all provocative and controversial, but none with the scope of vision he was to demonstrate in his next release, Nashville. As might be expected, the making of Nashville started out just as unfocused and haphazard as had all of Altman&#39;s prior films. His improvisational style, his disdain for linear story line, his reliance on the actors to find their own ways through to the end -- all these traits promised chaos many times over when imposed on a &#34;concept&#34; as complicated and fraught with potential problems as Nashville was. For Nashville was not one story, it was twenty-four separate stories, all happening at once, layered and overlapping, weaving in and out. And Nashville was not conceived as a film about a city and its industry (in this case, country music), but as a film about America and its obsession with fame and success. Stuart has undertaken the mammoth task of reaching all the principals involved with the creation of this landmark film, and has succeeded wonderfully in detailing the methods and the means by which it was put together, as well as providing an intimate look at the interplay of egos among the twenty-four actors and actresses who peopled this film. Given the benefit of full cooperation by Altman, who himself sat for many hours of interviews, Stuart&#39;s book, illustrated throughout with behind-the-scenes photos, is both an entertaining journalistic tour de force and a valuable tool for students of films and filmmaking.</p><p><b>Jan Stuart</b> is a film critic for <i>Newsday</i> and <i>The Advocate.</i> His essays, profiles, and criticisms of film and theater have appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, American Theater, Los Angeles Times, The Saturday Review, GQ, Elle, Travel and Leisure, 7 Days,</i> and <i>Mirabella.</i>Rightly considered both a critical and popular masterpiece, director Altman's 1975 film, Nashville, is a sprawling, audacious and brilliant mixture of political analysis and soap opera that features 23 major characters, all on a collision course with the American dream. This love letter to the film, the director and the cast is based on Newsweek movie critic Stuart's interviews with all of the cast and crew members who are still alive. He ably evokes the artistic excitement that galvanized the set amid the chaos of the filming (Altman, a great believer in improvisation, told his actors to ignore the script on the first day of filming), as well as the tensions that surfaced when the exacting, often cranky director clashed with many of his stars. Highlights are the insights of performers like Lily Tomlin, who relates how feminism and lesbianism shaped her wonderfully tender sex scenes with Keith Carradine (who claims to have "just wanted to get laid" during the filming"), and Barbara Harris, whose insistence on relying on her improvisational training at the Second City put her at odds with Altman. Stuart is at his best detailing the strained and often painful relationships between the starsAparticularly Ronee Blakley, who played the film's central characterAand the director. More an overview of the film and its principal players than a sustained critical analysis or a day-by-day account of the filming, this amiable journalistic account will please the film's legion of fans more than it will film critics or historians.

Exceptions were allowed for players who had upset their coaches by skipping practice or violating other rules. In such cases, a coach could file a report before the game and inform the scorekeeper that so-and-so wouldn&#x2019;t play much, if at all, because of some infraction. This was frowned on by the league; it was, after all, much more recreational than competitive. <br><br>With four minutes left in the game, Coach Kyle looked down the bench, nodded at a somber and pouting little boy named Marquis, and said, &#x201c;Do you want to play?&#x201d; Without responding, Marquis walked to the scorers&#x2019; table and waited for a whistle. His violations were numerous&#x2013;skipping practice, skipping school, bad grades, losing his uniform, foul language. In fact, after ten weeks and fifteen games, Marquis had broken every one of the few rules his coach tried to enforce. Coach Kyle had long since realized that any new rule would be immediately violated by his star, and for that reason he trimmed his list and fought the temptation to add new regulations. It wasn&#x2019;t working. Trying to control ten inner- city kids with a soft touch had put the Red Knights in last place in the 12 and Under division of the winter league. <br><br>Marquis was only eleven, but clearly the best player on the court. He preferred shooting and scoring over passing and defending, and within two minutes he&#x2019;d slashed through the lane, around and through and over much larger players, and scored six points. His average was fourteen, and if allowed to play more than half a game, he could probably score thirty. In his own young opinion, he really didn&#x2019;t need to practice. <br><br>In spite of the one-man show, the game was out of reach. Kyle McAvoy sat quietly on the bench, watching the game and waiting for the clock to wind down. One game to go and the season would be over, his last as a basketball coach. In two years he&#x2019;d won a dozen, lost two dozen, and asked himself how any person in his right mind would willingly coach at any level. He was doing it for the kids, he&#x2019;d said to himself a thousand times, kids with no fathers, kids from bad homes, kids in need of a positive male influence. And he still believed it, but after two years of babysitting, and arguing with parents when they bothered to show up, and hassling with other coaches who were not above cheating, and trying to ignore teenage referees who didn&#x2019;t know a block from a charge, he was fed up. He&#x2019;d done his community service, in this town anyway. <br><br>He watched the game and waited, yelling occasionally because that&#x2019;s what coaches are supposed to do. He looked around the empty gym, an old brick building in downtown New Haven, home to the youth league for fifty years. A handful of parents were scattered through the bleachers, all waiting for the final horn. Marquis scored again. No one applauded. The Red Knights were down by twelve with two minutes to go. <br><br>At the far end of the court, just under the ancient scoreboard, a man in a dark suit walked through the door and leaned against the retractable bleachers. He was noticeable because he was white. There were no white players on either team. He stood out because he wore a suit that was either black or navy, with a white shirt and a burgundy tie, all under a trench coat that announced the presence of an agent or a cop of some variety. <br><br>Coach Kyle happened to see the man when he entered the gym, and he thought to himself that the guy was out of place. Probably a detective of some sort, maybe a narc looking for a dealer. It would not be the first arrest in or around the gym. <br><br>After the agent/cop leaned against the bleachers, he cast a long suspicious look at the Red Knights&#x2019; bench, and his eyes seemed to settle on Coach Kyle, who returned the stare for a second before it became uncomfortable. Marquis let one fly from near mid- court, air ball, and Coach Kyle jumped to his feet, spread his hands wide, shook his head as if to ask, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Marquis ignored him as he loafed back on defense. A dumb foul stopped the clock and prolonged the misery. While looking at the free-throw shooter, Kyle glanced beyond him, and in the background was the agent/cop, still staring, not at the action but at the coach. <br><br>For a twenty-five-year-old law student with no criminal record and no illegal habits or proclivities, the presence and the attention of a man who gave all indications of being employed by some branch of law enforcement should have caused no concern whatsoever. But it never worked that way with Kyle McAvoy. Street cops and state troopers didn&#x2019;t particularly bother him. They were paid to simply react. But the guys in dark suits, the investigators and agents, the ones trained to dig deep and discover secrets&#x2013;those types still unnerved him. <br><br>Thirty seconds to go and Marquis was arguing with a referee. He&#x2019;d thrown an F-bomb at a ref two weeks earlier and was suspended for a game. Coach Kyle yelled at his star, who never listened. He quickly scanned the gym to see if agent/cop No. 1 was alone or was now accompanied by agent/cop No. 2. No, he was not. <br><br>Another dumb foul, and Kyle yelled at the referee to just let it slide. He sat down and ran his finger over the side of his neck, then flicked off the perspiration. It was early February, and the gym was, as always, quite chilly. <br><br>Why was he sweating? <br><br>The agent/cop hadn&#x2019;t moved an inch; in fact he seemed to enjoy staring at Kyle. <br><br>The decrepit old horn finally squawked. The game was mercifully over. One team cheered, and one team really didn&#x2019;t care. Both lined up for the obligatory high fives and &#x201c;Good game, good game,&#x201d; as meaningless to twelve- year- olds as it is to college players. As Kyle congratulated the opposing coach, he glanced down the court. The white man was gone. <br><br>What were the odds he was waiting outside? Of course it was paranoia, but paranoia had settled into Kyle&#x2019;s life so long ago that he now simply acknowledged it, coped with it, and moved on. <br><br>The Red Knights regrouped in the visitors&#x2019; locker room, a cramped little space under the sagging and permanent stands on the home side. There Coach Kyle said all the right things&#x2013;nice effort, good hustle, our game is improving in certain areas, let&#x2019;s finish on a high note this Saturday. The boys were changing clothes and hardly listening. They were tired of basketball because they were tired of losing, and of course all blame was heaped upon the coach. He was too young, too white, too much of an Ivy Leaguer. <br><br>The few parents who were there waited outside the locker room, and it was those tense moments when the team came out that Kyle hated most about his community service. There would be the usual complaints about playing time. Marquis had an uncle, a twenty-two year-old former all-state player with a big mouth and a fondness for bitching about Coach Kyle&#x2019;s unfair treatment of the &#x201c;best player in the league.&#x201d; <br><br>From the locker room, there was another door that led to a dark narrow hallway that ran behind the home stands and finally gave way to an outside door that opened into an alley. Kyle was not the first coach to discover this escape route, and on this night he wanted to avoid not only the families and their complaints but also the agent/ cop. He said a quick goodbye to his boys, and as they fled the locker room, he made his escape. In a matter of seconds he was outside, in the alley, then walking quickly along a frozen sidewalk. Heavy snow had been plowed, and the sidewalk was icy and barely passable. The temperature was somewhere far below freezing. It was 8:30 on a Wednesday, and he was headed for the law journal offices at the Yale Law School, where he would work until midnight at least. <br><br>He didn&#x2019;t make it. <br><br>The agent was leaning against the fender of a red Jeep Cherokee that was parked parallel on the street. The vehicle was titled to one John McAvoy of York, Pennsylvania, but for the past six years it had been the reliable companion of his son, Kyle, the true owner. <br><br>Though his feet suddenly felt like bricks and his knees were weak, Kyle managed to trudge on as if nothing were wrong. Not only did they find me, he said to himself as he tried to think clearly, but they&#x2019;ve done their homework and found my Jeep. Not exactly high-level research. I have done nothing wrong, he said again and again. <br><br>&#x201c;Tough game, Coach,&#x201d; the agent said when Kyle was ten feet away and slowing down. <br><br>Kyle stopped and took in the thick young man with red cheeks and red bangs who&#x2019;d been watching him in the gym. &#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; he said, and immediately saw the shadow of No. 2 dart across the street. They always worked in pairs. <br><br>No. 1 reached into a pocket, and as he said &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what you can do,&#x201d; he pulled out a leather wallet and flipped it open. &#x201c;Bob Plant, FBI.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;A real pleasure,&#x201d; Kyle said as all the blood left his brain and he couldn&#x2019;t help but flinch. <br><br>No. 2 wedged himself into the frame. He was much thinner and ten years older with gray around the temples. He, too, had a pocketful, and he performed the well- rehearsed badge presentation with ease. &#x201c;Nelson Ginyard, FBI,&#x201d; he said. <br><br>Bob and Nelson. Both Irish. Both northeastern. <br><br>&#x201c;Anybody else?&#x201d; Kyle asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No. Got a minute to talk?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You might want to,&#x201d; Ginyard said. &#x201c;It could be very productive.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If you leave, we&#x2019;ll just follow,&#x201d; Plant said as he stood from his slouch position and took a step closer. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want us on campus, do you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you threatening me?&#x201d; Kyle asked. The sweat was back, now in the pits of his arms, and despite the arctic air a bead or two ran down his ribs. <br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Plant said with a smirk. <br><br>&#x201c;Look, let&#x2019;s spend ten minutes together, over coffee,&#x201d; Ginyard was saying. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a sandwich shop just around the corner. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s warmer there.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Do I need a lawyer?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you always say. My father is a lawyer and I grew up in his office. I know your tricks.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No tricks, Kyle, I swear,&#x201d; Ginyard said, and he at least sounded genuine. &#x201c;Just give us ten minutes. I promise you won&#x2019;t regret it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s on the agenda?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ten minutes. That&#x2019;s all we ask.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Give me a clue or the answer is no.&#x201d; <br><br>Bob and Nelson looked at each other. Both shrugged. Why not? We&#x2019;ll have to tell him sooner or later. Ginyard turned and looked down the street and spoke into the wind. &#x201c;Duquesne University. Five years ago. Drunk frat boys and a girl.&#x201d; <br><br>Kyle&#x2019;s body and mind had different reactions. His body conceded&#x2013; a quick slump of the shoulders, a slight gasp, a noticeable jerk in the legs. But his mind fought back instantly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s bullshit!&#x201d; he said, then spat on the sidewalk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already been through this. Nothing happened and you know it.&#x201d; <br><br>There was a long pause as Ginyard continued to stare down the street while Plant watched their subject&#x2019;s every move. Kyle&#x2019;s mind was spinning. Why was the FBI involved in an alleged state crime? In second-year Criminal Procedure they had studied the new laws regarding FBI interrogation. It was now an indictable offense to simply lie to an agent in this very situation. Should he shut up? Should he call his father? No, under no circumstances would he call his father. <br><br>Ginyard turned, took three steps closer, clenched his jaw like a bad actor, and tried to hiss his tough- guy words. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cut to the chase, Mr. McAvoy, because I&#x2019;m freezing. There&#x2019;s an indictment out of Pittsburgh, okay. Rape. If you want to play the hard-ass smart-ass brilliant law student and run get a lawyer, or even call your old man, then the indictment comes down tomorrow and the life you have planned is pretty much shot to shit. However, if you give us ten minutes of your valuable time, right now, in the sandwich shop around the corner, then the indictment will be put on hold, if not forgotten altogether.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You can walk away from it,&#x201d; Plant said from the side. &#x201c;Without a word.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Why should I trust you?&#x201d; Kyle managed to say with a very dry mouth. <br><br>&#x201c;Ten minutes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You got a tape recorder?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I want it on the table, okay? I want every word recorded because I don&#x2019;t trust you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; <br><br>They jammed their hands deep into the pockets of their matching trench coats and stomped away. Kyle unlocked his Jeep and got inside. He started the engine, turned the heat on high, and thought about driving away.<br>Excerpted from THE ASSOCIATE by John Grisham<br>Published by Doubleday<br>Reprinted with permission of the publisher.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Belfry Holdings, Inc.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>And the Word Came With Power: How God Met &amp; Changed a People Forever</h2><p>And the Word Came with Power: How God Met and Changed a People Forever</p><p></p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Be an Egyptian Mummy!: Disgusting Things You&#39;d Rather Not Know</h2><p>This lively, interactive series will enthrall young and reluctant readers by making them part of the story, inviting them to become the main character and revel in the gory, dark, horrific side of life throughout important eras in history. Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 4-6-At first glance, these profusely illustrated books appear to be a lighthearted approach to some grim chapters in the history of the world. Chapter titles are often blithe and the cartoon art depicts the gory and abominable treatment of one group of people by another. But closer examination of the texts and pictures reveals informative books, packed full of the facts students often seek. The first title describes the life of a woman from the Black Sea area who is kidnapped and taken to serve as a slave in ancient Greece. The treatment of the slaves by the aristocracy is depicted along with descriptions of everyday life. Gladiator highlights the superiority of the Roman army, which returned its prisoners to Rome where they were trained to be arena fighters. Rules of battle and types of gladiators are described. Mention is also made of the simulated sea battles that took place in the flooded arenas and of staged wild-animal hunts. Mummy covers the process of embalming and mummification along with the symbolic features of an Egyptian burial. Discoveries of tombs and modern beliefs about mummies are also included. While these books cover material included in other titles, their approach to history will be extremely popular with students who relish a bit of blood and guts along with their historical facts.<br><i>Elizabeth Stumpf, Clearfield Middle School, PA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Best of Burke: Selected Writings and Speeches of Edmund Burke (Conservative Leadership Series)</h2><p>No conservative library is complete without the thought of Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism.</p><p><b>Edmund Burke</b> (1729-1797) was a British statesman and political philosopher best known for his support of the American Revolution and denouncement of the French Revolution.

As chaplain to the Fire Department of New York, Father Mychal Judge was officially the first to go. A loving priest with a gift for the gab-gregarious yet humble, a healer with the ability to wipe away a widow's tears and put a smile on a fireman's face.<br><br>And on September 11th Father Mike rushed to the fires at the World Trade Center as quickly as those who fought them, losing his own life while tirelessly ministering to New York's bravest.<br><br><i>Father Mike</i> recounts the colorful, astonishing and at times troubled life of a priest who saw the potential for good in everybody-in the homeless person he slipped a dollar to on the street; the alcoholic he sought to coax to an AA meeting; the early victims of AIDS he embraced and comforted; the troubled young men he visited in jail; and the thousands of firefighters he blessed as they rushed to their rigs answering the call. <br><br>Here was a priest who rejoiced in the life around him and understood that even the most terrible times present us with wonders-that good always arises from the bad in the most unexpected ways. <br><br>Or as Father Mike would say, "My God is a God of surprises."<br><br>In this touching book, author Michael Daly retraces the footsteps of Father Mike as his vocation takes us inside the firehouse, inside his friary and his Church, and inside the chaos that often befalls New York.<br><br>This is the tale of a larger than life priest who, in death, became a symbol of how much we truly lost that Tuesday in September. <i>Father Mike</i> is the inspirational story of a hero priest who blessed so many lives and will long be remembered by it.</p><p>Michael Daly is a columnist for the <i>New York Daily News</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br>Chapter one <p></p><p></p>The first surprise was always the size and strength of his hands, hands that at the greeting clasp seemed meant for riveting the high steel or fielding a hot grounder, hands that blessed and anointed as if the spiritual were as actual as honest labor or tender sex. Hands that made the holy real, just as the hands of the firefighters waiting beside him prepared to make the real holy, hefting tools and tugging at air tank straps. <p></p>His own hands hung useless at his sides as he now stood on West Street in a Roman collar and a black standard-issue FDNY firefighter&#x2019;s protective turnout coat, gazing from under the brim of his white fire helmet. He and the firefighters around him were witnessing an elemental law of nature by which a falling object accelerates at thirty-two feet per second minus the particular air resistance, be the object a lead weight dropped by Galileo from the Tower of Pisa or a human being leaping from the upper floors of One World Trade Center. <p></p>Male or female, young or old, healthy or ill, urban or suburban, black or white or Hispanic or Asian, married or single, parent or childless, straight or gay, rich or poor, generous or miserly, kind or cruel, fierce or meek, virtuous or sinful, dreamy or practical, toned or flabby, Christian or Jew or Muslim or Hindu, all fell at the same ever-increasing rate. The only variants were density and surface area. Mundane business papers wafted gently down, but even the most decent person was soon plummeting at nearly 150 miles per hour. <p></p>Those who leapt from the topmost floors of the North Tower fell for as long as nine seconds. The people on the floors closest to where the plane actually hit had maybe seven seconds, still time to think of loved ones and pray to their particular notion of the Almighty. A Roman Catholic, for example, would have been able to say a Hail Mary but not an entire Act of Contrition. Everybody had time to utter "Oh, God!" or "God, no!" or some other plea even atheists cry at the onrush of death. All likely remained as keenly conscious as skydivers. <p></p>Some jumped together, holding hands. Most leapt singly, often tumbling as they fell. At least one man stayed feet first, his red-and-blue tie streaming above him. But most were on their backs as they reached the lower floors, facing the heavens if not necessarily heaven. Their last sight was of the perfect baby-blue sky as they struck the pavement with a velocity that instantly turned a living person into a bright red splatter. The sound was jarring, loud, a body becoming a bomb. <p></p>Other sounds, the wailing of sirens, converged from uptown and downtown and crosstown, more sirens than had ever been heard in the city. Engine companies and ladder companies and rescue companies kept arriving, eventually more than 240 FDNY units from all five boroughs. The attack had come just as the firehouses were changing shifts, and many companies arrived with double the usual contingent of five. Anyone who happened to be hanging around came, too. Those who could not cram onto the rigs drove their cars and pickup trucks or commandeered taxicabs. One young firefighter rode the subway from Midtown in full gear, standing amid gawking passengers. Off-duty firefighters reported on their own. One had been golfing. Another had been surfing at Rockaway, riding in to shore when he saw the distant smoke. Another bicycled from Brooklyn. Another hit traffic in the Battery Tunnel from Brooklyn to Manhattan and ran the rest of the way, emerging at the foot of the towers. <p></p>The firefighters who did not have equipment rummaged the rigs at the scene. They joined the others in pulling on air packs, grabbing tools, and shouldering thirty-pound hose lengths as they would at a routine tenement blaze. Then they saw the jumpers. <p></p>A figure would be tiny and indistinct at first, but grow more and more detailed as it fell closer, its gender and race soon becoming clear, then startlingly vivid, an individual human being in the instant before striking the pavement. The sound of each reminded the firefighters what would happen if one of these bodies struck them. There was none of the usual fire-scene banter as they gazed skyward and tried to gauge when they could dash those final steps into the tower while burdened with fifty-six and a half pounds of gear and whatever tools they carried. <p></p>"When I say run, you just run!" a fire officer shouted. The F.D.N.Y. chaplain stenciled in reflecting yellow letters on the back of Father Mychal Judge&#x2019;s turnout coat marked him as one figure unburdened of even the expectation that he dash into danger. He could have stayed at the staging area across from the tower with nobody thinking less of him. The sick and the dying and the bereaved had often said that the touch of his big Irish hands seemed the Almighty&#x2019;s own and that he looked heaven-sent with his warm blue eyes and a marquee-handsome face lined only by his smile. But he could no more save those still trapped above than he could catch those who jumped and landed with such force there was nothing even to anoint. He was a sixty-eight-year-old priest, three years past the age when a firefighter would be forced to retire, and he could pray just as well from where he stood. <p></p>Still he had always stood witness at the forward command post as the firefighters battled what they sometimes called the Red Devil. And on this morning when there was only hell on high, absolute evil seemed to be challenging the value of life itself. <p></p>Just the day before, Judge had ended a firehouse dedication in the Bronx by placing his big right hand over his heart and singing "God Bless America." He now listened mutely to the unholy detonation of body on pavement, each seeming to be mocking proof that the cosmos was ultimately and absolutely indifferent, that the differences between people were inconsequential because people themselves were of no consequence, that what was real was just real, that if there is a God, then He has no hands at all. <p></p>Yet all around him was the manifest grace of firefighters poised to risk everything to save those of whatever persuasion, firefighters who routinely challenged the cosmic indifference of combustion and gravity by placing all lives ahead of their own. They moved as one when the order came to "Run! Run! Run!" <p></p>For Judge to have let his fear rule him would have been to shrink before a challenge to all decent people, to have let evil win. He moved with the firefighters, his black lace-up shoes in pace with their fire boots across the field of carnage, crunching on the broken glass and skirting the fresh red splatters. <p></p>He was a priest who could make a paraplegic man feel lucky and make a dying AIDS victim feel the kiss on his forehead was the kiss of the Almighty Himself. He was so dashingly handsome, he once arrived in his habit at a party and was mistaken for a male stripper in costume. He was so brash, he made the cardinal sputter, and so devout, he was sometimes lost in prayer for hours. He brought laughter everywhere&#x2014;to the White House in the wake of scandal, even to grim vigils in the burn unit. He had a genius for saying exactly the right thing in the most extreme circumstances and knew when to say nothing at all. A former mayor called him his best friend, and homeless people listed him as their next of kin. He saw Alcoholics Anonymous as a miracle of wine into water where people struggled to save their own souls. He admired nobody more than those who saved lives, and on other days when firefighters died, he declared their firehouses holy ground, their spirit alive anew with every alarm. In the aftermath of this fire unlike any others, his own spirit would join with theirs to be more powerful than anyone could have imagined and, for a brief time anyway, defeat the evil and affirm all he believed. Those who loved him would remember what he often said of his most passionate love, who was neither man nor woman yet both. <p></p>"My God is the God of Surprises." <p></p>Excerpted from The Book of Mychal by Michael Daly <p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Michael Daly <p></p>Published in 2008 by Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

While we talk constantly about the difficulties in making money, we tend to ignore the waste that surrounds us and to overlook opportunities for improvement. </p><p> We tend to look at time as something that <i>adds</i> value. Job experience, for example, is considered a function of time based on accumulated experiences or hours spent in producing goods. Instead, we should view time as something that <i>erodes</i> value when it is misspent. We should take specific actions to accelerate the improvement of operations and thereby run our workplaces more efficiently -- so that we can move forward. </p><p> Scenes in the Factory </p><p> Before talking about what we can or should do to improve our workplaces, let us first get a few comments from the people in the factory: </p><p> <i>Shop foreman:</i> "Most of our people are working very hard. We are doing everything possible to improve our practice here. It just takes time for us to get to where we want to be." </p><p> <i>Plant manager:</i> "We have many things going on in our factory. We are doing SPC [statistical process control] training and quality circle activities. We have implemented a suggestion program. We have MRP [material requirements planning]. We have even introduced robotics and an automated warehouse. But somehow, I have a feeling that things are not going well. For example, the number of suggestions is low, machines are still breaking down, quality level is not as high as I want to see it, sudden schedule changes are still common, and so on. Because of these things, I spend too much time chasing fires and attending daily meetings." </p><p> <i>Chief executive officer:</i> "I don't know what's going wrong. I have attended seminars and conferences; I have looked around and hired consultants for help. But what I have accumulated so far are lots of documents, papers, fragments of thoughts, and so on. Somehow I haven't been able to integrate them into a plan of action yet." </p><p> These are comments I hear quite often. People are concerned about day-to-day problems, fires in the factory, and the like. They are attending seminars and reading about new management techniques. But they are missing something they need to know, and they feel confused. Perhaps there is even feeling of resignation (or satisfaction) that people have done their best and cannot do better. </p><p> While developing an integrated understanding and setting priorities are important processes in our work, a fundamental question is whether we have spent enough time finding out what's really happening on the factory floor. So, let us spend some time here to review some typical operations found in the factory. </p><p> In one area, we see an operator carrying a heavy workpiece by hand. In another area, we see people working frantically to stay on schedule after finding that an entire batch produced a few hours earlier was out of tolerance. We also see people watching a machine run, sorting good parts and bad parts, waiting for the delivery of material, stacking up inventory, and fixing machine breakdowns. When we check the way people are producing, we find they may be working just because materials are there to work on, rather than following certain prescribed procedures or disciplines (see Exhibit 1.1). </p><p> We need to ask ourselves "How many of these activities are absolutely necessary for our production activities?" and "How many of these activities are adding value to the product -- rather than cost?" Or we might ask ourselves, "how many of these activities are related to things the customer sees and cares about?" </p><p> Waste </p><p> Fujio Cho of Toyota defines <i>waste</i> as "anything other than the minimum amount of equipment, materials, parts, space, and worker's time, which are absolutely essential to add value to the product." As early as the 1920s Henry Ford was concerned with the problem of waste. He discussed it specifically in his book <i>Today and Tomorrow,</i> which Toyota people diligently studied later. To put it in simple terms, "If it doesn't add value, it's waste." </p><p> When we review the time people spend in the factory, for example, we often find that more than 95 percent of an operator's time is not being utilized to add value to the product. Rather, it is adding cost to the product. When we measure the material being processed in the factory, we may also find that, during more than 95 percent of the time, that material is in storage, waiting to be transferred, processed, or inspected. Similarly, a machine may be producing unnecessary or defective products, or it may be broken down or require maintenance. In either case, it is obviously not being used to add value to the product. Exhibit 1.2 is a graphic representation of the problem. </p><p> People may say, "We know all of that." But the questions we should ask ourselves are, "Then what are we actually doing to reduce this waste?" "How much of our time is spent on eliminating this waste?" "Do we really know how much of this waste can be eliminated?" "Do we really know how much dollar savings can be achieved through such efforts?" </p><p> Unfortunately, most of us cannot answer these questions. One thing we should remember is that a lot of our work requires immediate action. The urgency of such matters can keep us from analyzing and planning our work. We may feel we have accomplished more when we spend time on urgent work and exhaust ourselves. But is it really a productive way of using our time? The following portion of this chapter is devoted to answering these questions. </p><p> <b>Seven Wastes</b> </p><p> What we are talking about here is the need to introduce production improvement practices where the action is taking place, that is, on the shop floor. By diligently practicing problem solving with as many people as possible, many of our current problems will disappear. </p><p> While each person's ideas will be used to facilitate the improvement of factory operations, the most powerful results can be obtained by implementing improvement activities in the most integrative fashion so that each island of improvement can be tied together with the others. Also, we want to develop certain approaches to facilitate these improvements so that the improvement process becomes effective. In order to achieve such goals, we need to understand more about waste in the factory. </p><p> While products made in each factory may be different, the typical wastes found in factories are very similar. After years of improvement activities, Toyota identified the following seven types of waste as the most prominent ones. </p><p> <b><i>Waste from overproduction.</i></b> Toyota concluded that overproduction is one of the worst wastes commonly found in factories. This waste is created by producing goods over and above the amount required by the market. When the market is in an upswing, this waste may not be prominent. However, when market demand slows, the effects of overproduction are compounded and companies often get into trouble carrying unsold goods as extra inventory. </p><p> Overproduction waste is typically created by getting ahead of the work. When this happens, more raw materials are consumed and wages are paid for unneeded work, thereby creating unnecessary inventory. This in turn requires additional handling of materials, additional space to hold inventories, and additional interest paid to the bank for money used to carry the inventories. It may also require additional people to monitor inventories, additional paperwork, extra computers, more forklifts or warehouse space, and so on. </p><p> Furthermore, excessive inventory leads to confusion about what needs to be done first. It also distracts people and prevents them from focusing on immediate objectives or tasks. As a result, additional production control people are required. Since operators seem busy and machines are occupied unnecessarily, additional equipment may be purchased on the mistaken assumption that it is needed. </p><p> Since overproduction creates difficulties that often obscure more fundamental problems, it is considered one of the worst wastes and should be eliminated. In order to do so, we first need to understand that machines and operators do not have to be fully utilized, as long as market demands are met. (This may seem odd to many people, but it makes sense.) </p><p> Operators at each stage of production should think of the next process as their "customer" simply because the next process involves working on the product produced in the previous process. We should make sure that only the amount required by the customer is produced, at high quality, low cost, and at the time needed. </p><p> <b><i>Waste of waiting time.</i></b> While waste from overproduction is not always easy to identify because the operators appear to be busy (even though their work does not add value to the product), waste of waiting time is usually easy to identify. </p><p> In fact, waste in the form of waiting <i>should</i> be exposed, so that corrective action can be taken. For example, instead of occupying machines to overproduce goods, operators should remain idle when the required amount of work is finished. With this practice in place, supervisors can thus better assess the capacity and control the situation more readily. </p><p> If we look around the factory, we also find operators simply watching machines run. Some may say that machines must be watched so that corrective action can be taken quickly whenever a problem arises. But is that not already too late for an operator to take action? Shouldn't there be a mechanism that automatically stops the machine and buzzes or lights up to alert an operator when an abnormal condition occurs? </p><p> Another way to look at this is that there will be no initiative to eliminate the causes of such problems because these problems are not being exposed clearly to the supervisor's eyes; instead they are often resolved by operators without a supervisor's knowledge. Even though some supervisors may prefer to ignore such problems as long as production schedules are met, should such practices be allowed? </p><p> <b><i>Transportation waste.</i></b> Transportation waste and double or triple handling are also commonly observed wastes in most factories. For example, incoming material may be stored in the warehouse before it is brought to the line. With such a practice, a tracking person has to be informed where to pick up the material, where to store it in the warehouse, where and when to pick it up again, and where to deliver the material down the line. He may even have to bring materials left over from the line back to the storage area if there is a lack of coordination. </p><p> Ill-planned layouts may make long-distance transportation necessary. They can also result in double or triple handling of parts that have been put away in a disorderly manner and then kept in temporary storage and switching storage locations. Often we are amazed to discover how many miles a product must travel through the factory before it is completed. </p><p> In order to eliminate this waste, improvement in layout, coordination of processes, methods of transportation, housekeeping, and workplace organization need to be considered. </p><p> <b><i>Processing waste.</i></b> The processing method itself may be a source of problems, resulting in unnecessary waste. For example, a certain die-casting operation may require additional labor to file and finish the surface. But a finishing operator may be quite unnecessary if the die is maintained well or if manufacturability had been considered in the product design. </p><p> Also, in manufacture of the products, certain aspects of the painting, sealing, or bolt-tightening processes may be unnecessary in meeting product requirements. </p><p> When fixtures are not well maintained or prepared, operators may have to use extra effort in processing the materials. Certain defects may be produced by these inappropriate processing procedures. </p><p> An example of improvement in a drilling operation to eliminate waste in processing is represented in Exhibit 1.6. </p><p> Certain fixtures may be added or modified to facilitate operation of a machine. For example, the use of an air cylinder or chain and sprocket may help to automate the machine drilling operation. Similarly, the power of the drill machine motor may be used to eject the finished product automatically. Also, the combination of a gravityfed chute and fixture may make automatic loading possible, thereby totally eliminating operator involvement. </p><p> <b><i>Inventory waste.</i></b> As discussed above in connection with waste of overproduction, excess inventory increases the cost of a product. It requires extra handling, extra space, extra interest charges, extra people, extra paperwork, and so on. </p><p> Because of the problems associated with unnecessary inventory, we should consciously try to reduce inventory levels. </p><p> * Dispose of obsolete materials (housekeeping/workplace organization).<br> * Do not produce items not required by the subsequent process (line balance).<br> * Do not purchase or bring in items in large lot sizes (savings achieved through volume discounts, may be more than offset by inventory waste).<br> * Manufacture products in small lots (reduced setup time/more changeovers). </p><p> As we begin to reduce inventory levels, we may find more problems that need to be addressed before the inventory level can be reduced further. This is comparable to reducing the water level to expose the rocks as shown in Exhibit 1.8. </p><p> Because of the many problems associated with inventory, we need to pay more attention to clearing out the waste associated with inventory. To emphasize this point, let's just say that excess inventory is the root of all evil. </p><p> <b><i>Waste of motion.</i></b> Whatever time is not spent in adding value to the product should be eliminated as much as possible. One fact we should constantly bear in mind is that "move" does not necessarily equal "work": </p><p> An operator may keep "busy" for three hours looking for tools all around the factory without adding even a penny of worth to the product. Instead, he has increased the cost of the product by three hours of his wages together with three hours of production lead time before delivery of the product to the customer. </p><p> We can find many other examples of this kind of waste. <i>Pick and place</i> is another example of movement that can be reduced by keeping parts or tools closer to where they are used -- or even eliminated by using chutes and other fixtures. </p><p> Walking is another kind of wasteful movement, especially when one person is responsible for operating several machines. Machines should be placed so that the operator's walking time is minimized. </p><p> <b><i>Waste from product defects.</i></b> When defects occur at one station, operators at subsequent stations waste time waiting, thereby adding cost to the product and adding to production lead time. Furthermore, rework may be required or the defective products are scrapped. If a defect has occurred in the assembly operation, additional labor is required to disassemble the product, and additional parts are required for reassembly. Obviously, schedules must be adjusted to accommodate these changes. </p>...</p><h2>Head and Heart: The Story of the Clinical Pastoral Education Movement</h2><p>Head and Heart: The Story of the Clinical Pastoral Education Movement</p><p></p><h2>Rosie&#39;s Bakery All-Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed, No-Holds-Barred Baking Book</h2><p>Here are the hands-down temptingest--and surprisingly easy-to-make--150 cakes, cookies, pies, puddings, and custards ever assembled.

Winner of a 1991 IACP/Julia Child Cookbook Award. Illustrations throughout.</p><p>Readers smitten with the rich stuff of Boston's Rosie's Bakery will be wooed by proprietor Rosenberg's assorted recipes and personal revelations. The fixings for calorie-laden cold fudge sundae cake, chocolate fruitcake and brownie cheesecake are interspersed with well-organized information on equipment, methods, ingredients and decorating tips. Many readers will be amused when Rosenberg bares her sweet-toothed soul, telling how she devised her "Yin and Yang of calorie consciousness": while living on "a strict diet of brown bread, cheese, fruit, nuts,sic and vegetables," she would think nothing of polishing "the meal off with a fat slab of cheesecake." But despite a smattering of recipes with truly novel twists (e.g., mustard gingerbread), much here will be found in other cookbooks. Still, "Rosie" is a redoubtably charming alter ego, and while not all of Rosenberg's favorites are originals, the writing is worth the tariff. Illustrated.

I thought for a second. I knew what I wanted: I wanted a cheap acoustic guitar. You can get them for about seventy dollars at Best Buy. They come in an exciting cardboard box. I saw two boxes, leaning against a wall, waiting, last time I was there. I almost said that&#x2019;s what I wanted&#x2014;I came dangerously close to saying it&#x2014;but then I didn&#x2019;t, because you really can&#x2019;t ask your former girlfriend for a guitar, even a cheap guitar. It&#x2019;s too momentous a present. It presupposes too much. It puts her in an awkward position. And of course you can&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;What I really want is I want you back,&#x201d; either. </p><p>So instead I said, &#x201c;I think what I really want is an egg salad sandwich.&#x201d; Roz has a particular way with egg salad&#x2014; she adds in a rare kind of paprika or tarragon or some elusive spice I don&#x2019;t understand. &#x201c;We could meet at Fort McClary,&#x201d; I&nbsp;said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring the picnic basket and the sliced carrots if you bring the egg salad sandwiches.&#x201d; </p><p>Fort McClary is a place we used to go sometimes to smell the seaweed and look at the boats. I think it&#x2019;s where the Revolutionary War began, but I&#x2019;m not sure. There are huge hewn Stonehengeian stones tumbled about in the grass that were going to be part of a defensive wall that never got built. I think Paul Revere rode his poor snorting horse all the way to Fort McClary to warn that the British were coming, which was the beginning of a pointless trade war that didn&#x2019;t need to happen. </p><p>Roz was silent for a moment. </p><p>&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;if a picnic is too heavy-duty we could just have lunch at the Friendly Toast.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, no, I can definitely make you an egg salad sandwich,&#x201d; she said. I could hear her smiling the indulgent smile of someone who once loved somebody a long time ago. </p><p>We agreed to meet at Fort McClary and have a birthday picnic. </p><p><br>Early this morning I had a literary dream. Roz was still living with me and I was supposed to review a book of 1S military recipes called Mess: Great Food from Army Kitchens.</p><p>Roz and I were testing one of the recipes, which was for octopus-walnut muffins. Roz pulled the tray of muffins out of the oven and I bit into one. &#x201c;How does it taste?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not too good,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised,&#x201d; she said. We shook our heads and tried to think of a way I could say something nice about the cookbook. </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you could praise the walnuts?&#x201d; Roz said. </p><p>I woke up.<br></p><p>I&#x2019;m parked on Inigo Road, which is my favorite road anywhere. I wish I could write about the phrase &#x201c;happy phrase,&#x201d; but there&#x2019;s no time. Very soon I&#x2019;m going to be Fifty Fucking Five. The three Fs. The last time I hit three Fs was ten years ago, and this time is definitely worse. Unless you&#x2019;re Yeats or Merwin you are done as a poet at fifty-five. Dylan Thomas was in the ground for sixteen years at fifty-five. Keats was dead at, what, twenty-six? Riding on horseback with his sad lungs coughing blood. And as for Wilfred Owen. </p><p>The first time I read Keats&#x2019;s sonnet &#x201c;When I Have Fears,&#x201d; I was eating a tuna sub. I was an applied music major, with a concentration in bassoon. I&#x2019;d found the poem in The Norton Anthology of Poetry&#x2014;the shorter black edition with the Blake watercolor of a griffin on the cover. I propped the Norton open with my brown plastic food tray and I started reading and eating the tuna sub and drinking V8 juice occasionally from a little can. </p><p>Keats says: &#x201c;When I have fears that I may cease to be.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;When I have fears that I may,&#x201d; you know, &#x201c;drop dead,&#x201d; or &#x201c;breathe my last&#x201d;&#x2014;no, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;cease to be.&#x201d; I stopped chewing. I was caught by the emptiness and ungraspability in that phrase. And then came the next line, and I made a little hum of amazement: &#x201c;When I have fears that I may cease to be,&#x201d; Keats says, &#x201c;Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain.&#x201d; </p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to pretend that the cafeteria spun around. It stayed still. I heard the grinding sound of the cash register printing. But I was thinking very hard. I was thinking about a large tortoiseshell that somebody had given me when I was small. There was a sort of fused backbone on the inside of it that ran down the middle. This bony ridge smelled terrible when you sniffed it close-up, although it had no odor from a normal distance. I imagined the tortoiseshell as the top dome of a human skull, and I imagined Keats&#x2019;s pen gleaning bits of thought flesh from it. </p><p>The pen is really the only tool sharp enough to do the job of brain-gleaning properly. Keats knew that. He had medical training. He was supposed to be a doctor. He didn&#x2019;t like medical school much, but he assisted at surgeries. The idea of the inside of the head as an object that had crevices and hiding places&#x2014;that it was gleanable&#x2014;was something that he knew firsthand. And he also knew, because he was a sick man, that his fears were justified. His mother died of consumption. He was a fourteen-year-old boy when he stayed up watching her 1S die. He knew what it meant for a complicated gentle person to simply cease to be. And his brain was teeming with the unwrittenness of what he had to say. He had to hurry. He knew all that.</p><p>The rest of the poem isn&#x2019;t nearly so good, but it ends with a bang: &#x201c;Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.&#x201d; </p><p><br>I didn&#x2019;t bring the list of things I wanted to write about today. Sometimes I note things I want to write about on a folded piece of paper, but I left my piece of paper in my bed. It&#x2019;s an empty bed. This may be one of the empty-bed birthdays. I&#x2019;ve had a few. </p><p>But a summer birthday is a good thing. On the branch near my car, on every twig that isn&#x2019;t dead, there has been a lot of activity. The sap is up in these trees, and the leaves have had no choice but to move outward. Billions of buds in each tree, the leaves tremblingly uncurving, squirming outward. It&#x2019;s a forced migration. The sap is pressurized and the leaves have to flee outward from the very ends of the twigs. What it creates is a fog of green over all of Inigo Road. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve just been waiting for summer, waiting and wanting, and now it&#x2019;s here. Yesterday was actually hot, and today I&#x2019;ve put a Post-it note on the corner of my computer screen: NO YUKON JACK TILL YOU FINISH. I need a new drug. Huey Lewis sang that song and then foolishly sued Ray Parker, Jr., claiming that Parker had pinched the bassline for the Ghostbusters theme. </p><p>I&#x2019;m debating whether to buy a can of Skoal smokeless tobacco. </p><p><br><br>Three quick farewell shots of Yukon Jack. Oh my flipping God. Deep breath now. Hello, my strangely shaped figments, I&#x2019;m Paul Chowder. I&#x2019;m here and so are you. We are in the same Minkowski space, shaped like a saddle. You&#x2019;re in the saddle and I&#x2019;m in the saddle and we&#x2019;re not going to fall off Revere&#x2019;s horse because it doesn&#x2019;t exist. </p><p>My knees are laughing. Is that allowed? </p><p>Here&#x2019;s my tip of the night. Nod. It&#x2019;s worth nodding at things sometimes. Just give a big nod. That&#x2019;s the way they are? Okay, nod, yes. Practice nodding. </p><p>Thirty-five years ago, when I was twenty, I sold my Heckel bassoon. And that was that. Now I&#x2019;m supposed to be writing a new book of poetry, which I&#x2019;m calling Misery Hat. I don&#x2019;t want to work on it. Today, to get inspired, I dipped into an extremely long poem by Samuel Rogers called Human Life, because I liked the title. It didn&#x2019;t do much for me, but I remembered that Samuel Rogers was friends with Tennyson and Coleridge, and that made me haul out my old edition of Tennyson and look at his extremely long poem Maud, narrated by an insane person who rambles. Tennyson was very ill if not clinically insane when he wrote parts of Maud, and a lot of it is unreadable. But there is one very nice soaring patch that everyone remembers. It begins, &#x201c;Come into the garden, Maud, / For the black bat, night, has flown.&#x201d; There Tennyson has us. Night itself is a black bat. How thrilling and&nbsp;un-Victorian is that? In the same passage there&#x2019;s a mention of an unusual chamber group that&#x2019;s apparently been serenading the roses all night long&#x2014;a flute, a violin, and a bassoon. It&#x2019;s a bassoon not because Tennyson knew anything about the bassoon, but because he needed an evocative word to rhyme with &#x201c;tune&#x201d; and &#x201c;moon.&#x201d; And also because he may have been&nbsp;remembering another poetical bassoon passage, from Coleridge&#x2019;s Ancient Mariner: </p><p>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,<br>For he heard the loud bassoon.</p><p>Coleridge didn&#x2019;t know much about the bassoon either, or he wouldn&#x2019;t have said it was loud. The bassoon&#x2019;s liability as an orchestral instrument is that it is quite soft, much softer in volume than its size would suggest. At a wedding reception in 1797, when Coleridge was working on his poem, it might have been used to double the bassline played by the spinet or the cello. But bassoonists the world over are grateful to Coleridge for including them in his stanza. </p><p>Charles Darwin knew slightly more about the bassoon than either Coleridge or Tennyson. When he was old and sad he asked his son to play bassoon for a heap of earthworms, to study their responsiveness to low sounds. He also played a tin whistle for them and pounded on the piano and shouted at them. &#x201c;They took not the least notice,&#x201d; Darwin said. There&#x2019;s also a poem about the vowels by John Gould Fletcher, one of the Imagists. The letter U, according to Fletcher, sounds like &#x201c;torrid bassoons and flutes that murmur without repose, / Butterflies, bumblebees, buzzing about a hot rose.&#x201d; Fletcher read the torrid bassoons passage to Amy Lowell in London, and later he wrote an autobiography called Life Is My Song. Later still, depressed, he drowned himself in less than three feet of water in a recently dredged pond in Little Rock, Arkansas. </p><p>Selling my bassoon was one of the biggest mistakes I&#x2019;ve ever made. I&#x2019;ve regretted it a thousand times since. And here&#x2019;s the strange thing. I&#x2019;ve written three books of poems, and I&#x2019;ve never once written a bassoon poem. I have never used the word &#x201c;bassoon&#x201d; in a single poem. Not once. I guess I was saving it up, which is not always a good idea. </p><p><br>Nan, my next-door neighbor, asked me to help with her chickens. She has five hens plus one droopy-tailed bantam rooster who has a reputation for being fierce and territorial, although he&#x2019;s always fine with me, staring at me warily from one eye and cock-a-doodling a fair amount. Nan is away in Toronto taking care of her mother, who isn&#x2019;t doing well. She, Nan, has been acting a little odd recently&#x2014;preoccupied and remote. It could be that she&#x2019;s worried about her mom, but also I think her &#x201c;friend,&#x201d; Chuck, is maybe no longer in the picture. He takes care of submarines, and there was an arson fire at the Navy base in Kittery that caused half a billion dollars&#x2019; worth of damage to a very fancy nuclear submarine. A worker at the base confessed to setting the fire because he wanted to leave early that day. That&#x2019;s how things are in the navy.</p><p>All I have to do is let the chickens out in the morning, so that they can spend the day pecking for trifles in the grass. I scatter some cracked corn under the bushes to give them a better peck-to-success ratio. Then, as dusk comes, I wait for them to file back into their shed and I close the door. You can&#x2019;t herd them, you just have to wait till they go in of their own accord. I&#x2019;ve gotten in the habit of bringing my white plastic chair over to Nan&#x2019;s yard and waiting for them to be done with their day. If I don&#x2019;t close the door, the chickens may be attacked at night by raccoons or foxes. </p><p>Ah, there they go now, filing into their enclosure. The hens are big and brown and fluffy, and their back parts are white with chickenshit and egg laying. The rooster is small and iridescently blue-black. I guess they mate all night, I don&#x2019;t know.

I practically live in my car these days, and I usually buy gas at Irving Circle K. One reason I like Irving is that they play oldies music from tinny speakers at the gas pump. Another reason is that they leave the little clickers in the pump handle so that you can start filling your tank and then go inside to buy a bottle of Pellegrino water and a bag of Planter&#x2019;s trail mix from a man at the register who looks like he&#x2019;s nursing a massive hangover. Today at Irving I went back out to the car with my purchases and I absentmindedly tried to drive off without removing the gas spout from my car. I heard a clunk and looked back and saw the pump hose lying on the ground, surrounded by what seemed to be a dark spreading stain of gasoline. I thought I&#x2019;d torn off the handle. I said, &#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; and got out, and then I saw that it was just a trick of the shadows. The spout was fine. It had pulled free of the car and fallen, and there was no sign of damage to the hose and no leaked gas. I felt a huge relief. I drove off singing a song that I heard a few weeks ago in Quaker meeting, called &#x201c;How Can I Keep from Singing?&#x201d; One of the meeting elders, Chase, had stood in the silence and said that all morning he&#x2019;d been remembering a song that Pete Seeger used to sing. Pete Seeger learned it from a singer named Doris Plenn, Chase said, who learned it from her grandmother. And then he sang it. He wasn&#x2019;t a great singer, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. &#x201c;My life flows on in endless song,&#x201d; he sang. &#x201c;Above earth&#x2019;s lamentation.&#x201d; I was so impressed by the song that when I got home I looked it up on iTunes and bought two versions of it, one by Bruce Springsteen and one by a group called Cordelia&#x2019;s Dad, accompanied by slow fiddle chords. </p><p>Long ago the Quakers were opposed to music&#x2014;they said that the effort a musician expended to learn an instrument kept him from worthier pursuits.

The notoriously shy performer mostly ceded the spotlight to his more flamboyant bandmates John, Paul, and Ringo, but after the band&#x2019;s breakup, Harrison charted a new path all his own. In this elegant, in-depth biography, renowned music journalist Graeme Thomson tracks Harrison assiduously through his many changes and conflicts, from schoolboy guitarist to global superstar, God-seeker to independent filmmaker, and marks the perennial struggle of a man attempting to walk a spiritual path lined with temptation.&nbsp;<br><br> Drawing on scores of new interviews with close friends and collaborators, rigorous research and critical insight, <em>George Harrison: Behind The Locked Door</em> is a fascinating account of the motives and varied achievements of an often misunderstood man.</p><p>Graeme Thomson is one of Britain&#x2019;s leading music writers.

Beginning artists will first see a work in full, then the same painting broken down into details. Finally, young artists will be able to use these examples to create their own masterpieces.<p>A painting may be flat, but the picture itself may be very lifelike. In this book, readers explore how artists lead a viewer's eye right into their paintings. Works by Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet are included among the examples. Beginning artists can then try working with distance in their own paintings.</p></p><p>Grade 1-4-In simple, succinct phrases, Richardson describes famous paintings by renowned artists. Each two-page spread takes a look at a different work of art; the left-hand pages present a full-color reproduction while on the right a number of details in close-up views are accompanied by questions or comments. For example, when viewing Domenico Ghirlandaio's Portrait of a Girl in Faces, readers are asked to notice the color of the subject's skin, the lines under her eyes, and the light on her hair, and to offer an opinion on whether or not she is smiling. Studies in perspective are featured in Distances. The sky seems to touch the ground in Edgar Degas's Beach Scene, while foreground figures loom dramatically large in Paolo Uccello's The Rout of San Romano. In Shadows, the effectiveness of light, darkness, and their contrast is explored in Geertgen tot Sint Jans's The Nativity, at Night, Jan Vermeer's The Lacemaker, and in many other masterpieces. Observant youngsters will see where the different sources of light originate and how strong light makes colors brighter and shadows deeper. Each title has a few activities. While the questions and suggestions posed by the author will help children become more discerning when examining paintings, they do get somewhat repetitious. However, like a number of other recently published art series, these titles will introduce young students to terms, techniques, and a broad range of styles.<br><i>Patricia Mahoney Brown, Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, Kenmore, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Revelation (Ironside Expository Commentaries)</h2><p>This classic commentary series from one of the most creative and articulate expositors of the twentieth century is being reissued for a new generation.</p><p>H.A.

Author Stanley Coren discusses at length the evolution of language in many species, and focuses as much on body language as he does on verbal communication. This is a man with his own theories on language development--when disagreeing with Chomsky or Darwin, he backs up his arguments with plenty of thorough, firsthand experience. <p> Separate chapters devoted exclusively to interpreting the movement of tails, ears, and bodies are fascinating, and can often provide surprisingly quick insight into canine behavior. There's a tremendous difference between showing affection and showing dominance, and humans have a strong tendency to misread our dogs' behavior and reward them in exactly the right way to ensure the continuation of frustrating behavior. Coren maintains that dogs can often learn far more words than we give them credit for--certainly, we've all seen pooches go bananas at the words <i>walk</i> and <i>cookie</i>, but he also suggests we watch for learned behaviors from certain words. Perhaps <i>office</i> gets your spaniel waiting by the door, or <i>baby</i> results in your terrier checking in on your child's location--you may just think it's cute, but actually, it's a sign of your dog's linguistic ability. </p><p> Whether you own a dog or two or work in the field of animal care, this manual will be a most informative read and is sure to have a positive effect on the relationship between you and man's best friend. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>Stanley Coren</b> is a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of <i>The Left-Handed Syndrome, The Intelligence of Dogs, Sleep Thieves, What Do Dogs Know?</i> and <i>Why We Love the Dogs We Do.</i> He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p><h2>Just Tell Me What to Eat!: The Delicious 6-Week Weight Loss Plan for the Real World</h2><p>Dr. Timothy Harlan has counseled thousands of overweight patients searching for weight-loss answers.

It emphasizes a Mediterranean diet with high-quality calories and home cooking whenever possible. Dr. Harlan offers a "food mantra" for each day, paired with a menu and easy recipes. By the time you incorporate all the lessons in your diet, you will have naturally slimmed down and changed your eating habits for the better</p><p>With chapters like "What You Should Eat for Breakfast," "How to Arrange Your Dinner Plate," and "Carbs are Good for You Too!" this unique day-by-day plan will help even the most frustrated dieters achieve a slimmer, healthier, and happier lifestyle.</p></p><p>In many ways I've been writing <i>Just Tell Me What To Eat</i> for about 25 years. Ever since my first book I have been writing what I have affectionately called "The Book." I've wanted to bring together sound science with real food to offer people a realistic alternative to a long line of fad diets that have failed them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem has been the state of the scientific research into diet and nutrition. Only in the last decade or so have we really had a significant body of good, reliable research into the relationship between diet and diseases like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. That's what has allowed me to write <i>Just Tell Me What to Eat</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without the benefit of sound science, in the last 40 years we've seen an explosion of well-meaning authors who created diets that focused on the wrong thing - not food but the macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and proteins. These diets have stolen food from us and changed the conversation in such a way that we no longer think of food as food. Now people think about food in terms of macronutrients, which are either "good" or "bad" with no grey areas. First carbs were demonized - essentially stolen from us for no good reason - and then fats were labeled "bad" based on incomplete science.<br> &nbsp;<br> That's been unfortunate because the recent boom of research into food and nutrition tells us that the right diet is not about any one macronutrient - it's about food and moderation. Those who eat real food and in the right balance do well. They lose weight and have fewer heart attacks, less diabetes and lower risk of cancer.<br> &nbsp;<br> In our day to day lives, eating is not about macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats, it's about food! We don't go to the store and look for carbs. When we're there we don't ask the butcher for protein. No one opens their fridge and says "hmmm, what fat will I have for dinner?" What we look for is food - pasta, rice, corn, pork tenderloin, shrimp, olive oil and butter.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> And the best way to eat healthy is to start thinking of food as food. Protein, carbohydrates and fats are important, but what's really key is great quality tuna and flank steak, tomatoes, apples, pecans, beans, corn, olive oil and yogurt.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the last 25 years, as I've been writing about nutrition and reviewing the research, it has become clear to me that the discussion we need to be having is about ingredients, not macronutrients, and <i>Just Tell Me What To Eat</i> does just that. It shows readers why each of the macronutrients are necessary and good for you and how to use the best quality ingredients to make great food."Does a masterful job of matching good, up-to-the moment science with good old- fashioned taste." --Graham Kerr, The Galloping Gourmet<br><br> Finally, the truth about weight loss: You can drop extra pounds and treat common health problems with easy changes in your diet. Even better, many of the foods you already love are actually good for you!<br><br> As a physician and a chef, Dr. Timothy Harlan has counseled thousands of people searching for weight-loss answers. Now, in this simple, medically based, 6-week plan, Dr. Harlan cuts through all the confusing diet trends and gets straight to the bottom line: your daily prescription for what to eat and why--and exactly how you can do it.<br><br> For anyone tired of restricted meals and unappetizing strategies (who really wants to avoid pasta for the rest of their life?), Just Tell Me What to Eat! takes the guesswork out of eating well. It emphasizes delicious, hearty meals, a Mediterranean-style diet, high-quality calories, and home cooking whenever possible. When you follow Dr. Harlan's basic food rules and balanced recipes, you really can eat:<br><br> * Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp and Broccoli<br><br> * Barbecue Chicken Pizza &nbsp;<br><br>* Philly Cheese Steak&nbsp;<br><br>* Red Beans and Rice&nbsp;<br><br>* Crab Cakes<br><br> * Oven-Fried Chicken with Roasted Corn on the Cob<br><br> * Chocolate Cheesecake<br> Dr. Harlan is well aware that there are times when you simply won't want to think about cooking, so he accompanies each of his daily recipes with two quick alternatives: a conve- nience meal and a restaurant meal recommen- dation.

These carpets are made from the hairs of wives and daughters; they are so detailed and fragile that each carpetmaker finishes only one single carpet in his entire lifetime.<br><br>This art descends from father to son, since the beginning of time itself.<br><br>But one day the empire of the God Emperor vanishes, and strangers begin to arrive from the stars to follow the trace of the hair carpets. What these strangers discover is beyond all belief, more than anything they could have ever imagined...<br><br>Brought to the attention of Tor Books by Orson Scott Card, this edition of <i>The Carpet Makers</i> contains a special introduction by Orson Scott Card.<br></p><p><i>Andreas Eschbach </i>was born 1959 in Ulm, Germany. In 1996, his first novel, <i> Die Haarteppichkn�pfer</i> (<i>The Hair Carpet Makers</i>), won one of the highest awards of German science fiction, the SFCD-Literaturpreis. His second novel, <i>Solarstation</i>, won the other great German science fiction award, the Kurd La�witz Preis. His third novel, <i>Jesus Video</i>, won both of them, became a nationwide bestseller in 2000, and was turned into a movie in 2002. <br><br>His first translation into another language was in 1998, when <i>Die Haarteppichkn�pfer</i> was published in France as <i>Des milliards des tapis de cheveux</i>. It was not only the first German science fiction novel to be published in France after 18 years, it also won two literary prizes in France and Belgium. Several novels and short stories have been translated since then, into French, Italian, Czech, Japanese, Russian, and Turkish.<br><br>Eschbach currently lives in Stuttgart with his family.<br>Set on a low-tech world where the main industry is the manufacture of carpets of human hair, German SF author Eschbach's first novel forms a grim mosaic of stories of myriad people and cultures trapped in stagnation by one powerful man's petty anger. Intended for the emperor on a distant planet, the carpets are so finely made that each carpet maker can only finish one in his lifetime, working with hairs from the bodies of his wives, who are chosen for the quality and color of their tresses. And so life goes, generation after generation, even after rumors and, finally, ships from the new government arrive with word of the emperor's removal. The new interstellar government learns the emperor secretly maintained thousands of carpet-making planets. Why? Eventually, the reader finds out the answer, though the revelation comes almost as an afterthought. While Eschbach's vignettes do form a fragile whole, the structure lacks urgency or focus. There's bound to be extra publicity because Orson Scott Card, who provides an intro, helped discover the book, but while Card fans will enjoy the large-scale world building and historical detail, they may be disappointed by the lack of real characters or sustained plot. <i>(Apr. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Often called the � father of modern Russian realism, � he was one of the first Russian authors to criticize his country� s way of life. Although his early works were heavily influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, he wrote in Russian and his works belong to the tradition of Russian literature. Gogol was one of the first masters of short prose, alongside Pushkin, Mérimée, Hoffmann, and Hawthorne. The main and most persistent characteristic of Gogol� s style is its verbal expressiveness. He wrote with a view not so much to the acoustic effect on the ears of the listener as to the sensuous effect on the vocal apparatus of the reciter. The other main characteristic of his genius is the extraordinary intensity and vividness of impressionist vision, sometimes skirting expressionism. The Dead Souls (1842), The Inspector-General and The Overcoat (1842) are among his masterpieces.</p><p>Ukrainian-born Russian dramatist and novelist. Gogol&#39;s humorous and satirical writings formed the basis of 19th century Russian realist literature.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Fifty Years of Wicca</h2><p>Frederic Lamond has spent 50 years following the path of Gardnerian Wicca, adapting and innovating along the way. An initiate of Gerald Gardner&#39;s Brickett Wood Coven in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s, which heralded the rebirth of Wicca in modern times, he has been a witness to the significant events that have shaped Wicca in the USA and UK. Fifty years since the publication of Witchcraft Today, Frederic Lamond offers a penetrating assessment of what modern Wicca has achieved in that time its successes, its failures and its future. This insider&#39;s overview of the Wiccan world is full of in-group gossip, shrewd observation and a one-of-a-kind perspective of the half-century revival of the old craft.</p><p>Frederic Lamond was born in 1931 and studied Economics at Cambridge, and Planning at the University of Chicago. He worked in marketing and in computers, and he has been an independent consultant since 1975. In 1957 he was initiated into Gardnerian Witchcraft (now called Wicca). He is a member of the Fellowship of Isis, the Church of All Worlds and the Children of Artemis, and is the author of many articles and three books. Having travelled extensively in Europe and North America, he now lives in Austria.</p><h2>Too Soon to Say Goodbye</h2><p>When doctors told Art Buchwald that his kidneys were kaput, the renowned humorist declined dialysis and checked into a Washington, D.C., hospice to live out his final days. Months later, &#x201c;The Man Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Die&#x201d; was still there, feeling good, holding court in a nonstop &#x201c;salon&#x201d; for his family and dozens of famous friends, and confronting things you usually don&#x2019;t talk about before you die; he even jokes about them.<br>Here Buchwald shares not only his remarkable experience&#x2013;as dozens of old pals from Ethel Kennedy to John Glenn to the Queen of Swaziland join the party&#x2013;but also his whole wonderful life: his first love, an early brush with death in a foxhole on Eniwetok Atoll, his fourteen champagne years in Paris, fame as a columnist syndicated in hundreds of newspapers, and his incarnation as hospice superstar. Buchwald also shares his sorrows: coping with an absent mother, childhood in a foster home, and separation from his wife, Ann. <br>He plans his funeral (with a priest, a rabbi, and Billy Graham, to cover all the bases) and strategizes how to land a big obituary in <i>The New York Times</i> (&#x201c;Make sure no head of state or Nobel Prize winner dies on the same day&#x201d;). He describes how he and a few of his famous friends finagled cut-rate burial plots on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard and how he acquired a Picasso drawing without really trying.<br><br>What we have here is a national treasure, the complete Buchwald, uncertain of where the next days or weeks may take him but unfazed by the inevitable, living life to the fullest, with frankness, dignity, and humor. <br><b><br></b>&#x201c;[Art Buchwald] has given his friends, their families, and his audiences so many laughs and so much joy through the years that that alone would be an enduring legacy. But Art has never been just about the quick laugh. His humor is a road map to essential truths and insights that might otherwise have eluded us.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Tom Brokaw<br><b><br></b></p><p>Art Buchwald was born in Mount Vernon, New York, and raised in Hollis, Queens. After serving as a marine in the Pacific during World War II and attending the University of Southern California, Buchwald left the United States for Paris. There, he landed a job with <i>Variety</i> magazine and began writing his now-legendary columns, syndicated for decades in hundreds of newspapers. He received the Pulitzer Prize for outstanding commentary in 1982 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986. He was the author of thirty-three books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Leaving Home</i>, a collection of political commentary, <i>Beating Around the Bush</i>, and a memoir, <i>Too Soon to Say Goodbye. </i>Buchwald died in the Winter of 2006.<i>Starred Review.</i> "Being in the hospice didn't work out exactly as I had planned it," begins Buchwald in what may or may not be his final book. In February 2006, Buchwald was told he would need ongoing dialysis, which he promptly decided to discontinue, moving into a Washington hospice to die on his own terms. What was intended to be a three-week exit for the Pulitzer Prize-winning author turned into months of visitors, rumination and writing. The result is this hilarious, sobering and unconventional study of the issues that accompany the end of life, such as living wills and surrogates, funerals, food and even sex. As he has throughout his career, Buchwald pares down overwhelming topics into manageable steps, gently and with humor, noting that, for instance "the beauty of not dying but expecting to, is that it gives you a chance to say goodbye to everybody," and it's these goodbyes that provide Buchwald with the framework to revisit his storied career-spanning two continents, populated by global luminaries and celebrated with multiple awards. Though entertaining as a talented satirist's retrospective, it's also a valuable primer on how to meet death with bravery and grace, reminding us that "the big question we still have to ask is not where we're going, but what we were doing here in the first place."<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Having sacrificed most of his Earth-based magical powers in the previous book, King Gaborn is sworn to pursue the army of unfathomable Reavers across the land of Mystarria, hoping to slay them before they can take refuge in their underground lair. A revelation from Averan, a young girl who's gained the memories of a Reaver by eating its brain, forces a change in plan, however. If the Reavers get underground, she learns, they will be rallied by the magic of the One True Master Reaver and return to fight, more deadly than ever. Averan's own budding Earth Power leads to her being chosen as apprentice by Gaborn's Earth wizard Binnesman, and her Reaver knowledge will make her an indispensable part of Gaborn's forces. In the meantime, evil forces seek to murder Gaborn's wife and prevent her from giving birth to a son who could be more powerful than his father, while Gaborn's enemy Raj Ahten--who, like Gaborn, is also losing his endowed Earth Power--pursues the Reavers through his kingdom as well. <p> In the end, the book stops just as things are finally starting to move, but while offering little plot development and no real surprises, this latest chapter in the Runelords saga is still likely to please Farland's dedicated fans. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i></p>The towering third book of the immensely popular Farland epic,<i> The Runelords</i><br><br>Certain works of fantasy are immediately recognizable as monuments, towering above the rest of the category.

She was a recipient of many distinguished honors and awards, including honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin, and Haverford Colleges, and was named New York State Poet (1991-1993).Lorde's ( A Burst of Light ) poems have always melded the political and lyrical worlds, the ordinary and the luminous, addressing controversial topics that she struggled with as a black lesbian poet, and the work in The Marvelous Arithmetics of Distance is no exception. These poems are reminders of her characteristic themes, from ecstatic poems of love and self-discovery to others grappling with cancer and the fear of death. The work here enhances Lorde's tradition of clipped, sparse lines that turn unexpectedly from one subject to another, and of arresting and often unabashedly political imagery. Some of the poetry about death is haunting, as in the last stanza of "Speechless:" "Death / folds the corners of my mouth / into a heart-shaped star / sits on my tongue like a stone / around which your name blossoms / distorted." Or in "Restoration: A Memorial--9/18/91," a poem describing the aftermath of hurricane Hugo, which devastated the house Lorde lived in, but was written from another continent, where she was undergoing chemotherapy: "In this alien and temporary haven / my poisoned fingers / slowly return to normal / I read your letter dreaming / the perspective of a bluefish / or a fugitive parrot." <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Knitting from the Netherlands, Traditional Dutch Fishermen&#39;s Sweaters</h2><p>Patterns for forty classic Dutch fishermen&#39;s sweaters are accompanied by vintage photographs and stories about the sweaters and the lives of the people who made and wore them</p><p>Text: English, Dutch (translation)</p><h2>The Terrible Twos</h2><p>When a &#34;Boss&#34; tries to buy the exclusive rights to Santa Claus--the &#34;Bosses&#34; being already in possession of Government and Religion--St. Nicholas, in league with his medieval partner Black Peter, unleashes a whirlwind of havoc and confusion</p><p>&#34;The Terrible Twos is a funny, sharp-edged fictional assault on all those sulky, spoiled naysayers needing instant gratification - Americans.

He argues that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 defies Article 1, Section 8, Paragraph 5 of the US Constitution by creating a &#34;central bank of issue&#34; for the United States. Mullins goes on to claim that World War I, the Agricultural Depression of 1920, the Great Depression of 1929, and Adolf Hitler&#39;s rise to power were brought about by international banking interests in order to profit from conflict and economic instability.

His books include <i>Looking After Aquarium Fish</i>, <i>Fish Care</i>, and several other pet/pet care books written for DK.In the fine tradition of its excellent how-to guides for raising houseplants, DK here offers a practical and visually appealing manual for all who would keep fish. The author has written various natural history titles and is a consultant to the pet industry. More than 800 individual fish, invertebrate, and plant species are described. <p>The book begins with a short introduction to the natural history of fish, their classification, and the history of fish keeping. The first major section covers the most popular kind of fish, those that live in fresh water. It begins with the practicalities of setting up and maintaining a tank, including descriptions of common problems and how to address them. Next is a very rich directory of fish organized by family or genus, with commonly available strains (including a few well-known rarities) discussed in terms of their size, temperament, and required conditions for culture. A brief directory of freshwater plants rounds out this section. </p><p>For those who like more of a challenge, marine fish are treated next. Following the same general structure as the freshwater fish section, Alderton divides marine fish into parts on culture and fish by family or genus, then finishes with a section on marine invertebrates. A shorter but still very useful section on the basics of keeping pond fish, again with sections on setup, fish by family or genus, and plants, finishes up the body of this volume. A glossary of terms, a handy list of Web sites, and indexes (one by common and scientific names, the other of more general terms) round things out.</p><p>This book is a fun read for fish keepers and voyeurs alike. The well-organized and authoritative content lives happily next to beautiful photographs. School and public libraries should strongly consider this volume for their reference shelves. A few circulating copies are a good bet to get heavy circulation in recreational collections at all levels. <i>Jeff Kosokoff</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Emerging from the ruins of Aztec civilization and from centuries of Spanish contact with indigenous people, Mexican culture followed the Spanish colonial frontier northward and put its distinctive mark on what became the southwestern United States. Shaped by their Indian and Spanish ancestors, deeply influenced by Catholicism, and tempered by an often difficult existence, Mexicans continue to play an important role in U.S. society, even as the dominant Anglo culture strives to assimilate them. Thorough and balanced, Mexicanos makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the Mexican population of the United States&#x2015;a growing minority who are a vital presence in 21st-century America.</p></p><p><p>Manuel G. Gonzales is Professor of History at Diablo Valley College. His books include Andrea Costa and the Rise of Socialism in the Romagna and The Hispanic Elite of the Southwest. He is editor (with Cynthia Gonzales) of En Aquel Entonces (IUP, 2000).</p>A thoughtful, thorough survey of events in the history of Mexican-Americans, Chicanos, Mexicanos, Hispanos, and Latinos. That so many terms should apply to the same people is the result, writes Gonzales (History/Diablo Valley Coll.), of that peoples quest over several generations for identity as an ethnic minority in the US. Since the 1960s Chicano has been a favored term yet one that is politically laden and not widely accepted in the mainstream. Neither, he believes, has Mexican historiography generally, because it has been both heavily politicized and largely confined academically to Chicano and ethnic studies departments. This ideological orientation, he writes, has worked against the complete acceptance of Chicano historians and other Chicano scholars by their colleagues in the academy. Gonzales suggests that Mexican is the better overarching term, especially because, in a broad survey taken in 1990, 62 percent of people of Mexican heritage born in this country preferred [it], as did 86 percent of the immigrant population. He also demonstrates by example that history need not be overtly politicized in order to score political points. He proceeds to unfold a lively narrative that begins with the Spanish conquest of Mexico and ends in the Gringolandia of the late 1990s. Gonzales has a sharp eye for historical ironies. In one section, for instance, he examines the role of the bandido, or bandit, in the mainstream cultures perception of Mexicans generally. Lawlessness, he writes, was not uniquely characteristic of the oppressed Mexican population; it was rampant on the frontier . . . . Indeed, some historians have seen a lack of respect for the law as an American tradition. Yet, he writes, accommodation by the conquered Mexican population was much more common than resistance; even though on the frontier they were despised as being racially inferior, most Mexicans struggled to be good citizens. That overlooked tradition, Gonzales notes, emerged in many ways: in the deeds, for instance, of Jos M. Lpez, an army sergeant who killed more enemy soldiers than any other American in World War II. And it continues today, he asserts, in the increased presence of Mexicans in all aspects of mainstream culture and particularly among the intelligentsia. Likely to be widely used in college history courses, Gonzaless book will be of much interest to general readers as well. (20 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The dangerous journey took three years to complete, as Amundsen, his crew, and six sled dogs waited while the frozen sea around them thawed sufficiently to allow for navigation. <br>We see him journey toward the North Pole in Fridtjof Nansen&#x2019;s famous <i>Fram</i>, until word reached his expedition party of Robert Peary&#x2019;s successful arrival at the North Pole. Amundsen then set out on a secret expedition to the Antarctic, and we follow him through his heroic capture of the South Pole. <br><br>Cox makes clear why Amundsen succeeded in his quests where other adventurer-explorers failed, and how his methodical preparation and willingness to take calculated risks revealed both the spirit of the man and the way to complete one triumphant journey after another. <br><br>Crucial to Amundsen&#x2019;s success in reaching the South Pole was his use of carefully selected sled dogs. Amundsen&#x2019;s canine crew members&#x2014;he called them &#x201c;our children&#x201d;&#x2014;had been superbly equipped by centuries of natural selection for survival in the Arctic. &#x201c;The dogs,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;are the most important thing for us.

Captions by Brian Pohanka, Foreword by Richard Stephenson. 176 pp., cloth, dj., maps in color, photos. And illus.</p><p>In the early days of the Civil War, generals stumbled about with bad maps or none at all. Soon enough, both sides established topographical corps and engaged cartographers, who produced thousands of field surveys, military maps, nautical charts, and general maps of regions and resources. Wartime needs led to new techniques, such as sunprinting and the use of photographic processes, which made it possible to produce maps quickly and in multiple copies for both military and commercial needs. Nelson tells the general story of wartime mapmaking well, if briefly, but in 12 chapters on individual campaigns he fails to show how maps affected strategy or tactics. Given the richness of the collection in the Library of Congress, it is surprising how few maps are presented here. Mapping the Civil War barely sketches the contours of the vital role maps played in winning the war. For major Civil War collections only.<br><i>- Randall M.

Four countless generations, Prince Madoc&#39;s blue-eyed descendants migrated along the great waterways of the primeval New World, mingling their blood, their legends, and their dreams with the native peoples. This is their story.</p><p>Thom's sweeping, ambitious historical novel describes the origins and journey of a lost white Indian tribe. Disillusioned with a homeland torn apart by familial power struggles, the Welsh prince Madoc, a blond giant, sets out with a fleet of ships in 1169 to start a colony across the ocean in the new land he calls Iarghal. Upon arrival, the Welsh settlers begin to interbreed with the native peoples while subjugating them. Generations later, neighboring Indian tribes band together and revolt against Welsh injustices. Only a few natives of mixed heritage escape the ensuing slaughter; they go on to found the Mandan nation, a tribe living near the Ohio River whose members are marked by their wheat-colored hair and blue or gray eyes. Thom (Follow the River, not reviewed) is wholly convincing as he depicts the history of Welsh settlement being distorted down through the ages, so that by the time Lewis and Clark make contact with the Mandan in 1804, the Welsh origins of their legends and traditions have been lost, even though one white sympathizer recognizes in the Mandan tongue a few Welsh words. Thom's well-meaning eagerness to depict Native American nobility often leads to an overly romanticized portrait; generation after generation, they seem impervious to any moral failing (in stark and too obvious contrast to each wave of European explorers, from the Welsh to DeSoto's Spaniards to early 19th-century French traders), and after a while the Indian characters begin to seem stultifying in their sameness. The female players are often weak victims and fade altogether from importance at the end of the novel. Nonetheless, a well-researched and intriguing, if somewhat idealized, fictional portrait of a legendary lost people. (First printing of 75,000; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A highly imaginative novel that combines an old legend with historical fact to create an epic tale of America starting some 300 years before Columbus arrived. Thom uses a long-discussed legend of Welshmen who traveled to the far-off land of Iarghal (the North American continent) during the twelfth century A.D. Here, despite overwhelming odds, Welsh chieftain Madoc builds a society by interbreeding his people with the local native tribes. The book then skips ahead in 70- to 80-year increments, describing the eventual assimilation and northern migration of the tribal descendants, recognizable as Welsh by their facial features and blond hair. All this is bookended by researcher George Catlin, a portrait artist who befriends the tribe, now called the Mandans, in the mid-nineteenth century. There are epic battles among the Welsh and the Native Americans and between the tribes themselves, as well as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and diseases; the sex is bawdy and the violence is unrelentingly bloody, but the individual human spirit shines through. Thom's use of the language is masterful, with early chapters featuring Madoc by using flowery, age-of-chivalry prose; later, the tales of the evolving Native American tribes are told in simple, almost childlike sentences that reflect their primitive but proud nature. Finally, the appearance of later explorers like DeSoto and Lewis and Clark is done in traditional style. A terrifically entertaining novel, particularly in dealing with the advance of white society from the Native American viewpoint. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>The Wicked Games of a Gentleman: A Novel (The Boscastles)</h2><p>Award-winning author Jillian Hunter gives us another irresistible story teeming with seduction, scandal, and secrets.<br><br>Lord Drake Boscastle has everything&#x2013;smoldering good looks, extreme wealth, and devilish charms.

She has received several awards, including the Romantic Times Career Achievement Award. Hunter lives in Southern California with her husband and three daughters.<i>Chapter One<br> London 1815</i><br><br> Lord Drake Boscastle had less than two hours to suffer through the party before his assignation with one of the most sensual women in all of Europe. If the evening went as well as he expected, he would make the celebrated English courtesan, Maribella St. Ives, his next mistress. He certainly hoped she would prove to be worth the rigmarole required for their rendezvous, or he would feel like a hell of a fool. He had spent a month corresponding with her and had presented her with a small fortune in gifts to prove his sincerity. Maribella&#x2019;s private agents had conducted an investigation to research his character. The last Drake had heard, even his cook had been questioned on what his master ate for dinner.<br><br> His indigo blue eyes darkened with irony at the thought. Any thorough check into his past would have yielded a treasure trove of scandals and indiscretions. It seemed, however, that Miss St. Ives was not put off by his reputation. Apparently he had met whatever qualifications she desired in a protector. He had been summoned to meet her tonight in a private suite at Audrey Watson&#x2019;s salon on Bruton Street. Salon, of course, being a euphemism for the exclusive bordello that its half-world hostess, Audrey, maintained.<br><br> His valet had efficiently packed a few personal necessities and a fresh change of clothes, not bothering to ask whether his master would be home before morning. Drake was rather hopeful he wouldn&#x2019;t return for a week. His life had been curiously devoid of pleasure lately, sex included. His capacity for enjoyment seemed to be diminishing by the day. He couldn&#x2019;t put his finger on the precise reason for his sense of dissatisfaction, but he was half-decided that if this affair with Maribella did not improve his outlook, he would return to soldiering.<br><br> &#x201c;Counting the minutes?&#x201d; his younger brother Lord Devon Boscastle asked from behind him.<br><br> Drake glanced around, grinning in reply. A small flock of debutantes stood gazing in breathless anticipation at Devon, whose openly playful charm made him appear far less of a threat than his more intense older brother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m down to seconds at this point,&#x201d; he said dryly.<br><br> Devon lowered his voice. &#x201c;Do let me know if Miss St. Ives has any sisters in the market for a protector. That is, if you can talk coherently at the end of the evening.&#x201d;<br><br> Drake shook his head and cast a sardonic glance across the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be talking all night. Haven&#x2019;t you heard that she&#x2019;s famous for her wit?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re interested in her? For conversation?&#x201d;<br><br> He punched his brother on the shoulder. &#x201c;Go dance with the debutantes, Devon. They&#x2019;re dying for you to ask.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t dance with all of them at once. Why don&#x2019;t you help me out?&#x201d;<br><br> He shook his head in amusement. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave the innocents to you. Anyway, I think I ought to conserve my strength.&#x201d;<br><br> One of their mutual male friends sauntered past them. &#x201c;I suppose we won&#x2019;t see you at the auction tomorrow, Boscastle,&#x201d; he said to Drake in an envious voice. &#x201c;Damn lucky devil.&#x201d;<br><br> Drake&#x2019;s answering laugh was suddenly drowned out by the blood-rousing strains of a country dance. He cast a halfhearted glance about for a partner. He&#x2019;d prefer the sister or wife of a friend rather than a timid debutante who would gaze at him in hopeful trepidation or chatter her empty head off after the set.<br><br> His restless gaze lit on a young, nicely built brunette in a plain lilac dress who was staring across the dance floor. She looked lost and . . . maybe a little frantic. She had an interesting sense of panic about her and an even more interesting silhouette. Good enough for what he had in mind. He only wanted to squander a few pleasant minutes with the woman, not marry her.<br><br> He strolled up behind her, clearing his throat at the cursory glance she granted him before turning away. Ignore him, would she? That was a challenge his devilish impulses could not turn down. &#x201c;Lost a sheep?&#x201d; he asked quietly, his chin brushing her ear.<br><br> Her soft white shoulders stiffened. He knew perfectly well she was aware of him, even if she refused to turn to meet his regard. &#x201c;Yes, in a manner of speaking,&#x201d; she answered distractedly.<br><br> At that point another man might have taken the hint and melted away. Instead, he studied her profile, the imperfect patrician nose, her stubborn chin, a lushly shaped mouth. His gaze drifted in lazy appraisal down her shoulders to the ivory curves of her full breasts above her neckline. &#x201c;Shall we look together?&#x201d; he inquired, masking his thoughts behind a polite smile.<br><br> She angled her head slightly to regard him. Her oval face bore an expression of practiced disdain that slipped as her eyes slowly met his. She blinked. He stared at her, enjoying his own rush of pleasant surprise. She was really quite lovely. He saw her bite the edge of her full bottom lip a little nervously before she retreated in a half step. She wouldn&#x2019;t ignore him now. She recognized a threat to female virtue when she saw it.<br><br> &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said, gently taking her arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hunt for your sheep on the dance floor. It just so happens that I&#x2019;m good at hunting.&#x201d;<br><br> She stared down guardedly at his hand before returning her shrewd gaze to his face. The shadow of a smile lifted those lushly curved lips. &#x201c;Wolves usually are.&#x201d;<br><br> He laughed, pleased but surprised at her response, and drew her forward. She gave a strong twist of resistance, although there was no room for her to escape. Guests had already filled the void where they&#x2019;d been standing. The ballroom was thronged elbow-to-elbow with elegantly dressed lords and ladies. Loud ones, too. Drake was reminded of a barnyard filled with clucking hens and braying asses, which didn&#x2019;t exactly speak well of his opinion of Society as a whole.<br><br> He could barely hear what his reluctant partner was attempting to say above all the chatter and music of the orchestra. &#x201c;Tell me about him later,&#x201d; he said in answer to her distressed look.<br><br> He didn&#x2019;t particularly want to talk, or dance for that matter. He simply wanted to pass time with this pretty stranger before a night of bliss-inducing sex with a courtesan he&#x2019;d met only once; and even during that meeting he and Maribella had not exchanged more than a few provocative words. This whole affair hinged on rumor and innuendo, which was what probably made it so intriguing.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a him,&#x201d; his partner said rather forcefully as he drew her resisting figure into the steps of the dance. An unexpected surge of arousal stirred his senses at the pliant warmth of her body. There was a pleasant sturdiness about her that appealed to him. She was an accomplished enough dancer to follow the pattern without seeming to pay attention. She seemed to be more concerned with looking for whomever it was she&#x2019;d lost than with his efforts to disarm her.<br><br> His hooded gaze studied her as she faced the stage. She wore her hair back from her face, a heavy cluster of chestnut brown waves that enhanced her creamy skin. No jewelry except for a pair of pearl earrings. Her lilac muslin dress hadn&#x2019;t been designed to impress anyone, either. In fact, she looked like a governess, or a lady&#x2019;s companion. Which would explain why she was looking for lost sheep. He&#x2019;d probably get her dismissed for dancing with him.<br><br> A middle-aged gentleman bumped into her as the set reconfigured. Drake gave the man a look and reached out his arm without thinking to steady her. Her full breasts pressed through his white linen shirtfront, another flagrant shock to his senses. He allowed his hand to fall to the rise of her well-rounded backside. Oh, yes. She felt very nice, very promising. He preferred a substantial woman in his bed.<br><br> &#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; she said, reaching back to pluck his hand away. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s fingers are straying where they don&#x2019;t belong.&#x201d; Her pretty oval face reflected a frowning disapproval that made him smile. She had hazel eyes, he realized. Dark brown and green dappled light at the same time. Intelligent and not entirely innocent.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to beg me for anything.&#x201d; All of a sudden his thoughts went a little wild. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you enjoy yourself for a moment?&#x201d;<br><br> She looked as if she&#x2019;d swallowed a boiled onion whole. &#x201c;Enjoy myself?&#x201d;<br><br> He caught her wrist. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you allowed any pleasure at all?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost my client,&#x201d; she said in vexation before the dance parted them again. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not here to enjoy myself.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do you want to go outside and look for her?&#x201d; he asked quietly, the epitome of chivalrous concern. It was as hot as an inferno in the ballroom, and he wouldn&#x2019;t mind leading her astray in the dark for a minute or two.<br><br> &#x201c;Outside,&#x201d; she muttered, her arched eyebrows drawing into a deep scowl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll throttle the wits out of her if that&#x2019;s where she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br> He started to laugh. He really wasn&#x2019;t making much of an impression on her. He trusted he&#x2019;d have better luck later in the evening. &#x201c;Do you always have this much trouble keeping your missing lamb in line?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;An army of Hussars couldn&#x2019;t keep that girl in line,&#x201d; she said in exasperation. &#x201c;Not that she wouldn&#x2019;t enjoy challenging them, mind you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that what you do?&#x201d; He followed her to the French doors that led to the garden, welcoming the excuse to leave the stuffy room. &#x201c;Keep unruly persons in line?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Eagle &amp; the Nightingales</h2><p>Disturbed by the growing presence of the Church throughout Alanda, Nightingale fears for her non-human friends and joins forces with birdman T&#39;fyrr in a quest to save the High King. Reprint.</p><p>The prolific and popular Lackey proffers the third volume of her Bardic Voices fantasy saga. One of the nightingales of the title is a gypsy bard who comes to Kingsford Faire and, before she leaves, is up to her eyebrows in intrigues both mundane and magical that involve a large cast of characters, not all of them human or even corporeal. The book displays Lackey's usual sound characterization, brisk pacing, and intelligently detailed world building, which will hold readers of both fantasy in general and Bardic Voices in particular. Lackey is sufficiently gifted that one continues to hope for work that is more original than what she has been producing lately. Still, she remains an undoubted mistress of the well-told tale, and if she does not dazzle, neither does she disappoint. <i>Roland Green</i>Nightingale and her friends are increasingly concerned about the Church's attitude toward non-human sentients that it doesn't control: her worries cause her to join forces with a birdman which turns into an unusual relationship as the two probe the ultimate influences behind the Church's decisions. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Everything Vegan Cookbook</h2><p>Veganism is about more than just avoiding meat and dairy; it's about cooking and eating healthy food while being good to the planet.

He stopped and stared. </p><p>"Somebody lost a boot," he said. </p><p>Even from where he stood, at least fifteen yards farther down the trail, Albert Lomatewa could see that nobody had lost the boot. The boot had been placed, not dropped. It rested upright, squarely in the middle of the path, its pointed toe aimed toward them. Obviously someone had put it there. And now, just beyond a dead growth of rabbit brush which crowded the trail, Lomatewa saw the top of a second boot. Yesterday when they had come this way no boots had been here. </p><p>Albert Lomatewa was the Messenger. He was in charge. Eddie Tuvi and the Flute Clan boy would do exactly what he told them. </p><p>"Stay away from it," Lomatewa said. "Stay right here." </p><p>He lifted the heavy pack of spruce boughs from his back and placed it reverently beside the path. Then he walked to the boot. It was fairly new, made of brown leather, with a flower pattern stitched into it and a curved cowboy heel. Lomatewa glanced past the rabbit brush at the second boot. It matched. Beyond the second boot, the path curved sharply around a weathered granite boulder. Lomatewa sucked in his breath. Jutting from behind the boulder he could see the bottom of a foot. The foot was bare and even from where Lomatewa stood he could see there was something terribly wrong with it. </p><p>Lomatewa looked back at the two his kiva had sent to guard him on this pilgrimage for spruce. They stood where he had told them to stand--Tuvi's face impassive, the boy's betraying his excited curiosity. </p><p>"Stay there," he ordered. "There is someone here and I must see about it." </p><p>The man was on his side, legs bent stiffly, left arm stretched rigidly forward, right arm flexed upward with the palm resting beside his ear. He wore blue jeans, a jean jacket, and a blue-and-white-checked shirt, its sleeves rolled to the elbows. But it was a little while before Lomatewa noticed what the man was wearing. He was staring at his feet. The soles of both of them had been cut away. The bottom of the socks had been cut and the socks pushed up around the ankles, where they formed ragged white cuffs. Then the heel pads, and the pads at the balls of the feet, and the undertips of the toes had been sliced away. Lomatewa had nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild, and had lived long enough to see many things, but he had never seen this before. He sucked in his breath, exhaled it, and glanced up at the hands. He expected to find them flayed, too. And he did. The skin had been sliced from them just as it had been from the feet. Only then did Lomatewa look at the man's face. </p><p>He had been young. Not a Hopi. A Navajo. At least part Navajo. There was a small, blackrimmed hole above his right eye. </p><p>Lomatewa stood looking down at the man, thinking how this would have to be handled. It had to be handled so that it would not interfere with the Niman Kachina. The sun was hot on him here, even though it was still early morning, and the smell of dust was in his nostrils. Dust, always dust. Reminding him of why nothing must interfere with the ceremonial. For almost a year the blessing of rain had been withdrawn. He had thinned his corn three times, and still what little was left was stunted and withering in the endless drought. The springs were drying. There was no grass left for the horses. The Niman Kachina must be properly done. He turned and walked back to where his guardians were waiting. </p><p>"A dead Tavasuh," he said. Literally the word meant "head-pounder." It was a term of contempt which Hopis sometimes used for Navajos and Lomatewa chose it deliberately to set the tone for what he must do. </p><p>"What happened to his foot?" the Flute Clan boy asked. "The bottom was cut off his foot." </p><p>"Put down the spruce," Lomatewa said. "Sit down. We must talk about this." He wasn't worried about Tuvi. Tuvi was a valuable man in the Antelope Kiva and a member of the One Horn Society--a prayerful man. But the Flute Clan boy was still a boy. He said nothing more, though, simply sitting on the path beside his spruce bundle. The questions remained in his eyes. Let him wait, Lomatewa thought. Let him learn patience. </p><p>"Three times Sotuknang has destroyed the world," Lomatewa began. "He destroyed the First World with fire. He destroyed the Second World with ice. He destroyed the Third World with flood. Each time he destroyed the world because his people failed to do what he told them to do." Lomatewa kept his eyes on the Flute Clan boy as he talked. The boy was his only worry. The boy had gone to school at Flagstaff and he had a job with the post office. There was talk that he did not plant his corn patches properly, that he did not properly know his role in the Kachina Society. Tuvi could be counted on but the boy must be taught. Lomatewa spoke directly to him, and the boy listened as if he had not heard the old story a thousand times before. </p><p>"Sotuknang destroyed the world because the Hopis forgot to do their duty. They forgot the songs that must be sung, the <i>pahos</i> that must be offered, the ceremonials that must be danced. Each time the world became infected with evil, people quarreled all the time. People became <i>powaqas,</i> and practiced witchcraft against one another. The Hopis left the proper Road of Life and only a few were left doing their duty in the kivas. And each time, Sotuknang gave the Hopis warning. He held back the rain so his people would know his displeasure . . ."</p></p><h2>Vulkan: Lord of Drakes (The Horus Heresy: Primarchs)</h2><p>As the Emperor marshals his armies to reclaim the galaxy for the glory of mankind, one by one his Space Marine Legions are reunited with their missing primarchs.

Joy lives in Webster, North Carolina.1 <br><br>Aiden was damn near starved to death when he inhaled the last half of his sausage biscuit in one gigantic bite. He balled up the Bojangles&#x2019; wrapper and shot it through the open window of his &#x2019;76 Ford Ranchero into the hospital parking lot. The front of his shirt was littered with crumbs and he picked one of the specks off his stomach, then brushed the rest into the floorboard. Shuffling in the seat, Aiden chewed that last morsel of food between his front teeth, a yellowed smile clacking on something too small to swallow.<br><br>If he&#x2019;d had any money, he would&#x2019;ve bought Thad something too. Of course, if he&#x2019;d had more money, he would&#x2019;ve bought a second biscuit himself. But aside from a few hundred dollars stashed away that he wouldn&#x2019;t touch, all Aiden had was ninety-four cents to his name. He&#x2019;d counted it while the acne-faced kid wrapped his order up and pushed the bag across the counter. That first sausage biscuit cost $1.22 after taxes, so Aiden just asked for a few extra packs of grape jelly, shook his head, and cussed his way through the door when the teenager told him that would cost him another fifty cents.<br><br>Aiden had always believed that as time moved on the world would open up, that life would get easier rather than harder. But as he closed in on his twenty-fifth birthday, things had just never turned the corner. Hard led to harder. Life had a way of wearing a man down into nothing. No matter what he did, it seemed some higher power had it out for him, and that kind of certainty comes to leave a man numb after a while. He ticked his teeth together even after there was nothing left to chew, him just staring off through the windshield onto memories.<br><br>Those years when they were boys, there were nights so still that as&nbsp;they paddled across the sky&#x2019;s reflection on Balsam Lake, the borrowed canoe seemed to slice the moon in half. The world split in their silent wake and lapped back together in their passing.<br><br>The lake was just a ten-minute walk from Thad&#x2019;s trailer and the state kept an Old Town canoe hidden in the crawl space of the game warden&#x2019;s cabin. The warden was never there. He had his own house and family somewhere down in Cullowhee and only used the cabin at Balsam Lake as a last resort when nights drew long chasing bear poachers&nbsp;and folks shining deer. In spring and fall, the state stocked rainbow trout, brookies, and browns, and they advertised those dates on a bulletin board.<br><br>When the days came, Aiden and Thad would hide in the woods and watch as the truck pulled up to the lake and a man in coveralls scooped bucketfuls of trout in a giant net and catapulted the fish out over the water. Come nightfall, the boys would string a trotline from one end of the lake to the other and paddle that canoe around catching fish on corn niblets and red wrigglers. They&#x2019;d smack those trout on the head with a Maglite, and by the end of the night the fishes&#x2019; quivering bodies would fill the boat to the brim. Aiden and Thad would eat good for weeks.<br><br>The older Aiden got, the more complicated the world had become, and so he preferred to live in the past, to relive those moments in his mind as often as he could. He believed that, given the right set of circumstances, he could re-create what had been before. With enough money and a fresh start, Aiden and Thad could set things right, but, as he waited in the hospital parking lot, that was about as far away as a man could dream.<br><br>When the housing bubble burst and the jobs dried up, Aiden thought it might last through the summer, maybe drag out a year at most, but sooner or later it would have to get rolling again. He was wrong and he&#x2019;d been out of work ever since. Thad wasn&#x2019;t around for the worst of it. He didn&#x2019;t get to see job sites go from dozens of crews with contractors raking up dollar bills one day to abandoned, stick-house skeletons without so much as a roof to stop the rain the very next. Thad was on deployment in Afghanistan when the construction business went to pot.<br><br>Those years Thad was gone, Aiden was jealous he was the one who got to leave. It was partly Thad&#x2019;s fault Aiden couldn&#x2019;t. When the school resource officer and a K-9 unit swept through the hallways and parking lot one morning at Smoky Mountain High and found two ounces of pot in Aiden&#x2019;s car, the truth was it was Thad&#x2019;s bag. But it was Aiden&#x2019;s ride and he kept his mouth shut. With a record filled with fistfights, him even stabbing a bus driver in the shoulder with a protractor once in middle school, Aiden fit the bill and administrators didn&#x2019;t bat an eye. He took the blame and the suspension and the felony and the community service and the drug class. The reality was that he and Thad were just two punk kids smoking pot, but the state determined severity, and anything over an ounce and a half was a felony&#x2019;s worth. That was the start of his adult rap sheet and that was the reason he couldn&#x2019;t join the Army. But, looking at how Thad came back, Aiden wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure who&#x2019;d had it worse. They&#x2019;d both had the rug yanked out from under them and now here they lay.<br><br>The Thad that ran off gung ho at eighteen years old ready to kill ragheads for flying planes into buildings wasn&#x2019;t the same Thad that hobbled back into the holler four years later with a ruptured disk at the base of his spine. The physical scars were trumped only by mental ones, by the way he never averted his eyes from the ridgeline, or how his dreams sent him into a sweaty panic. Thad left Jackson County just a dumb-to-the-world kid and came back malformed and hardened by bitterness and anger. That was the Thad who busted through the hospital door with a score to settle.<br><br>Aiden grabbed a pack of USA Gold Full Flavors from the vinyl bench seat. He lit a cigarette and watched as an older nurse, a pissy-�looking woman in teal scrubs with gray hair curled into a bun, followed Thad out the door. Aiden could hear her yelling, &#x201c;Mr. Broom! Mr. Broom!&#x201d; but Thad wasn&#x2019;t paying her one bit of attention. Instead, Thad walked over to where a short wall of bricks, maybe a foot and a half high, held back a bed of monkey grass and pansies.<br><br>Thad bent over and settled his hands onto one of the loose bricks and rocked it back and forth until the mortar crumbled from the edges like ash. When he&#x2019;d freed the brick from the wall, he held it over his shoulder and turned. The nurse crouched down with her hands over her face as Thad neared, as if he were going to kill her with it, but he didn&#x2019;t. He walked right past and she looked up in confusion as he took a few long-strided hops and smashed the glass door.<br><br>He stood there long enough to wrestle a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his jeans and light a smoke. He was in no hurry as he strolled to the car with his jaw cocked out and puffs of cigarette smoke marking every two or three steps. Aiden already had the Ranchero running when Thad slammed the door. Thad situated himself in the seat, ashed his cigarette into the floorboard, and gave Aiden a look like, What the hell are you waiting for? The nurse stood dumbstruck as they passed, and Aiden found himself thinking that they were leaving that place no different than they&#x2019;d found it, that most everything that came through the front door of the VA was broke all to shit.<br><br>The needle on the gas gauge teetered just left of half a tank and Aiden wasn&#x2019;t sure they had enough to make it home. There was an hour between Asheville and Jackson County, at least another forty-�five minutes from the county line to wind their way from Sylva to Little Canada. The bottom of the tank always burned up faster than the top, and Aiden figured best case they&#x2019;d coast in on fumes, but he didn&#x2019;t say anything. He steered down the ramp that led to I-40 and waited till Thad flicked that first cigarette into the wind before he spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell happened back there?&#x201d; Aiden asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Same shit as always, Aid.&#x201d; Thad jostled against the passenger-side door and slid his billfold from his back pocket. &#x201c;They give me an appointment to see a doctor, then that doctor tells me I need to see a specialist, and then that specialist takes six months to tell me he&#x2019;s going to need me to get an MRI and then I go to get an MRI and they tell me it&#x2019;s going to be another few months before the specialist can work me back in.&#x201d; Thad leafed through the few bills in his wallet slowly, then perused them a second and third time as if it might yield better results. &#x201c;I told that bitch that the VA benefits and that VA hospital ain&#x2019;t worth a fuck. I&#x2019;m on IRR for two more years and she tells me to calm down and I tell her that I ain&#x2019;t about to calm down, that it&#x2019;s been two goddamn years they&#x2019;ve been dicking around and my back&#x2019;s still broke all to shit. That&#x2019;s when she ran me out of there and that&#x2019;s when I broke her fucking door. We&#x2019;ll just see if those benefits cover glass.&#x201d;<br><br>Aiden felt around on the bench seat for his pack of cigarettes and shook one into his lips once he&#x2019;d found them. He slapped around the seat for his lighter, then traded hands on the steering wheel to pat his pants pockets, but came up empty.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; Thad said, holding his own lighter across the cab. He leaned to put his wallet back into his pocket, winced for a second as the pain seemed to run up his spine like current. &#x201c;Says an awful lot about a country that&#x2019;d rather cut a man a disability check than fix him up so he can go find a job.&#x201d;<br><br>Aiden steered the Ranchero with his knee and cupped the fire from the wind. When the cigarette was lit he passed the lighter back to Thad and said, &#x201c;There ain&#x2019;t no jobs anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still don&#x2019;t make it right,&#x201d; Thad said.<br><br>They rode along and did not speak for some time, just the sound of the world blowing past through the open windows. A mile ahead I-26 joined 40. There was much more movement here on the outskirts of Asheville than where the boys were headed. Off the highway over a line of trees, a crane swung a crossbeam into place on a three-story steel skeleton where welding arcs burned white as stars in the daylight.<br><br>&#x201c;One thing&#x2019;s for sure,&#x201d; Aiden said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot more jobs to be had over here.&#x201d;<br><br>Thad glanced toward the construction and nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;We could probably find something if we left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t ever leaving the mountains,&#x201d; Thad said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking about leaving the mountains. Hell, I don&#x2019;t want to leave the mountains, Thad. I&#x2019;m talking about leaving Jackson County.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And going where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here. Asheville. Maybe Hendersonville. Shit, they&#x2019;re putting up buildings every day. It&#x2019;d be easy for a man to find a decent job, and we wouldn&#x2019;t even have to move that far to find it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have no interest in moving to Asheville.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why the hell not? You said you want a job, and I&#x2019;m telling you they&#x2019;re here. Right here. So why not move to Asheville?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t moving to Asheville.&#x201d; Thad shifted irritably in his seat, his frustration evident in his voice. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t leaving Little Canada.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why the fuck not?&#x201d; Aiden looked over to Thad, who was rubbing his palms up and down his thighs nervously. He took a final drag from his cigarette and flicked the butt through the open �window.<br><br>&#x201c;Because there ain&#x2019;t but two places that&#x2019;ll ever make sense to me, and one of them is a place I can&#x2019;t ever go back to.&#x201d;<br><br>At the Sylva ABC store, Aiden waited in the car while Thad went inside to buy whatever whiskey was cheapest. Aiden was starved and he hoped the job that night might ease things for a while, might get them enough cash to last a month.<br><br>When the market fell to pieces, Aiden turned to stripping the same houses he&#x2019;d helped build. Thad was right about how the world seemed backward, how it was easier to eke out a living than to hold an honest-to-God job. A man could put in a half night&#x2019;s work for a full week&#x2019;s pay and never pay a dime in taxes. On top of that, the smart ones caught checks for unemployment or disability. So outlawing gets in a man&#x2019;s blood in such a way that even if there comes a day when he wants out, even if he gets tired of scraping by and wants to go honest, there isn&#x2019;t much of a demand.<br><br>In that way, this day was no different from any day that had come before, and that was part of what kept Aiden up at night: the cyclical nature of it all. For his entire life everything had been a continuous whirling of disappointment, the circle seeming to tighten and become just a little more certain with each passing year. Small arrest led to small arrest, and rap sheets became r�sum�s. Three-day sentences turned to ten and ten days turned to thirty, and in a place like Jackson County, second chances were given but third and fourth chances never happened. Aiden&#x2019;s reputation preceded him and he was too broke to leave. Too broke to leave is what gets a man to do it again and again, and before he knows it he&#x2019;s right back where he started. That&#x2019;s just the way the world turns. Every place has a backside and that was all he&#x2019;d ever known. In a county where 99 percent were hardworking, god-fearing people who&#x2019;d do anything for one another, folks like Aiden and Thad were walking, talking prayer requests.<br><br>At this point, even if the market turned around and the jobs came back, Aiden was out of favors. The only thing he could hope for was to save up enough money to move away. For months, he&#x2019;d been setting aside whatever little bit he could, nothing more than a few hundred dollars stashed in a hide at the house. He didn&#x2019;t want to leave the mountains. He would never leave the mountains. Flat land made him anxious, like the world was just too big. But he needed to get out of Jackson County, and a place like Asheville, where there were more people and more money and more jobs, made the most sense. That&#x2019;s where they needed to be.</p><h2>Star Wars: Rebel Rising</h2><p>An exciting story of adventure set within the Star Wars franchise.</p><p>Beth Revis is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best selling Across the Universe series; the companion novel, <i>The Body Electric</i>; a twisty contemporary novel, <i>A World Without You</i>; and numerous short stories.

Two major chapters cover the present: one focuses on recent work in the West, including the National Opera House of Norway in Oslo by Sn�hetta (2008), the Casa da M�sica in Porto, Portugal, by Rem Koolhaas (2005), and many more; the second examines the boom in concert halls in China.

But the emphasis of this precisely written, meticulously researched study is on the most recent work. And there are some fascinating stories behind the more celebrated examples.... What concerns [Newhouse] most is the connection between the visual and the aural, the relationship of the art of design to the act of listening, a synthesis that can take us into the sublime, one of the most complex and powerful experiences that architecture can provide.... Because she understands the nature and necessity of social, technological and architectural change, she goes beyond conventional architectural criticism and acoustical analysis to outspoken criticism of the results.

It&#x2019;s suprising that no comparable treatment of opera houses has been written before.... The pleasure of&nbsp;<i>Site and Sound&nbsp;</i>as a whole is how adroitly Newhouse navigates the dual audience&#x2014;the opera buff on the one hand, the design fanatic on the other&#x2014;with enough eye candy, backstage gossip, and techno&#x2013;shop talk to sustain the interest of both." &#x2014;<i>Surface</i> magazine<br><br>"In this meticulously researched and sumptuously illustrated volume, Newhouse, an architectural historian... goes on a global tour of new musical structures, giving particular attention to frenetic recent activity in China.

The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title.

These activities include sex with animals, sadomasochism and "intergenerational love affairs" such as the relationship between an 11-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man. These repugnant sections of this revised edition of a 1977 guide to male/male relationships mar an otherwise useful volume, with new and updated entries reflecting the AIDS crisis, safe-sex practices and the upsurge of gay political activism.

Here are twenty-two of the masters&#39; most beloved stories, from &#34;Rapunzel&#34; and &#34;Little Red Riding Hood&#34; to &#34;Cinderella&#34; and &#34;Hansel and Grethel,&#34; in a deluxe anthology based on a rare 1909 edition. Twenty-one full colour paintings and twenty-eight black and white drawings created by the legendary illustrator Arthur Rackham are filled with lush settings and delightful characterizations; his beautiful and evocative artwork is every bit as powerful as when first published nearly one hundred years ago. Such a fairy-tale meeting of words and pictures is certain to excite the imagination of every child and adult who holds - and treasures - this timeless collection.The Brothers Grimm The Grimm brothers were early 19th century writers best known for their fairy tales coming from Scandinavian, Icelandic and Germanic origins. By 1807 there was a growing interest in German folk tales. The Grim brothers were academics who invited friends to their home and asked them to relate stories they had heard. They soon published their first collection of tales and from there several more volumes followed. Included in this collection are Hansel and Gretel, Briar Rose, The Fisherman and His Wife, Rapunzel, The Frog Prince, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltshin, Tom Thumb and many more. These stories are a delight to read and will rekindle up many childhood memories as they are reread.</p><h2>Fail-Safe Investing: Lifelong Financial Security in 30 Minutes</h2><p>Do you worry that you're not paying enough attention to your investments? Do you feel left out when you hear about the clever things other investors seem to be doing? Relax. You don't have to become an investment genius to protect your savings. Distilling the wisdom of his thirty years' experience into lessons that can be applied in thirty minutes, Harry Browne shows you what you need to know to make your savings and investments safe and profitable, no matter what the economy and the investment markets do. There are no secret trading systems here, no jargon to learn. Instead, Harry Browne teaches you in simple terms to, among other things:<br><br>-Build your wealth on your career<br>-Make your own decisions<br>-Build a bulletproof portfolio for protection<br>-Take advantage of tax-reduction plans<br>-Enjoy yourself with a budge for pleasure<br></p><p>If you had to summarize <i>Fail-Safe Investing</i> in three words, it would probably be these: Embrace the obvious. Look at your job, Browne advises. You get ahead because of your experience, education, and common sense. Your job is the reason you have money to invest in the first place. So the first of Browne's 17 rules is, "Build Your Wealth upon Your Career." Don't jeopardize your career; it's going to take many years of smart investing before your earnings will surpass what you earn at your day job--if they ever do.<p> The other rules aren't quite as obvious, but equally simple. Browne explains the difference between investing (making a long-term plan and sticking with it) and speculating (betting that you can beat the overall market during a specific period). He shows how life savings are easily lost when you borrow money to invest rather than investing only the money you already have. Browne also suggests a portfolio that he says is the simplest and safest possible for continual, steady returns above inflation: an equal division among stocks, bonds, gold, and cash. That covers an investor in times of prosperity (stocks), inflation (gold), deflation (bonds), and recession (cash). While many investment analysts would undoubtedly gag if you presented them with a portfolio that consisted of a 50 percent investment in gold and cash, Browne nonetheless makes a compelling argument that such an allocation makes it easier to sleep at night. And common sense tells you there are worse things than a good night's sleep. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Harry Browne is one of America's best-known investment advisors, the author of eight investment books, a radio personality, and the 2000 Libertarian candidate for president.

The continual movement of time through winter, spring, summer, and autumn has framed human experience and profoundly affected the lives of individuals and communities for many thousands of years.</p><p>Celebrations that mark the seasons are rich with food, music, dance, offerings, and the reenactment of myth. <i>Jump Up</i> (titled after a Caribbean phrase that is used to describe a celebration) is meant to reacquaint readers with these traditions and to give them suggested practices for honoring past traditions in new ways.</p><p>African traditions form the core of the book, and ceremonies and practices from Europe, Asia, the Americas, and the South Pacific are interwoven throughout.

Is it the intoxicating and compulsive act of filling in small pools of color? Or the easy thrill of creating your own impressionist masterpiece? Or a fond nostalgic yearning for a craze that cut across national boundaries and age groups? Invented in 1951 by Dan Robbins-based on an idea used by Leonardo da Vinci to teach painting-the paint-by-number craze reached its zenith in the 1950s but continues even today as paints and kits are avidly collected, exhibited in galleries, and traded on eBay. In Paint By Number, author Larry Bird takes us on an unbelievable journey where art meets kitsch and popular and high cultures collide in a collage of home economics, leisure time fun, and art education, Bird revisits the hobby from the vantage point of the artists and entrepreneurs who created the popular paint kits, the critics who reviled them, and the consumers who enthusiastically filled them in and hung them in their homes. Paint By Number includes over 200 examples of paint-by-number ephemera and two pull-out paintings ready to be filled-in!</p><p>A mass culture obsessed with suburbia, leisure, and consumerism that sought access to high culture: that was 1950s America. Naturally, it was obsessed with paint by number, where all of these cross. A companion to an exhibition at the Smithsonian, <i>Paint by Number</i> follows the craze from its start to Andy Warhol's famous appropriation of the method in his "Do It Yourself" series. Paint by number pitted the creative against the mechanical, and deeply questioned art by giving everyone a paintbrush. This is a scholarly book and, at the same time, a comfortable read (as are most Princeton Architectural Press books), full of paintings, photographs, and ephemera such as advertisements and package designs, which alone stand as proof that one product can retell a critical part of the cultural history of America. It is a fantastic book for anyone interested in the intersection between art and culture in this fast-changing era. <i>--Juliette Cezzar</i>Invented in 1949 and reaching its zenith in the mid-Fifties, when millions of craft kits marketed with the slogan "Every man a Rembrandt" were sold for around $2.50 each, the paint-by-number fad spread throughout Eisenhower's burgeoning America, where garish scenes of covered bridges, dogs, ships, and cowboys hung over the sofas of new tract homes. This entertaining book accompanies an exhibition of 200 examples at the National Museum of American History on view through the end of 2001. Bird, a Smithsonian curator and author (Better Living, etc.), traces the history of the hobby and its mass appeal to middlebrow aspirations to culture, as well as the art world's derisively dismissive reactions. He also recounts fascinating examples of the fad's place in American culture, including the Stephens Collection of paint-by-number canvases completed by J. Edgar Hoover, Nelson Rockefeller, and other administration officials and displayed in the West Wing of the White House. As a bonus, two blank paintings with color instructions are reproduced inside the foldout covers. Recommended for American cultural history sections in libraries at all levels. Russell T.

A solitary postman serving a &#x201c;desolate&#x201d; outpost has nightmares about e-mail and fears he&#x2019;ll never have an adventure. Then one fateful day he delivers a letter to a raven&#x2019;s nest and finds a fledgling on the ground. He takes the little girl raven home; she matures quickly, relishing &#x201c;television and junk food,&#x201d; and they fall in love. Their egg-hatched daughter looks human, but she squawks instead of speaks, longs to fly, and confides, &#x201c;I feel all wrong.&#x201d; Away at college, she meets a plastic surgeon who thinks he can help. With her signature mordant wit, wry melancholy, and keen gothic sensibility, Niffenegger weds the fabulous with the deeply human in this concentrated, suspenseful fable of unlikely love, a struggle for selfhood, and a dramatic metamorphosis. Niffenegger&#x2019;s prose is precise and stinging, her etchings shadowed and graceful, her spellbinding story suffused with implications. Created in response to an invitation to collaborate with London&#x2019;s Royal Ballet, Raven Girl will take flight as a book and onstage. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Prayer: Our Glorious Privilege</h2><p>It is easy to read a book on prayer and walk away unchanged.

He authored over fifty books and today his Bible studies can be heard on the worldwide radio program, The Word For Today.I have read several books on prayer but I can honestly say that this book changed my life. It changed how I viewed God and approached Him; it changed how I regarded prayer and how often I frequented God s throne.

This book is a must for every believer who desires to grow closer to God s heart. The importance of prayer is unsurpassed in the Christian walk.

These 32 writers were among the thousands to jump-start feminism in our time. Here, in pieces that are passionate, personal, critical, and witty, they describe what it felt like to make history, to live through and contribute to the massive social movement that transformed the nation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>What made these particular women rebel? And what experiences, ideas, feelings, and beliefs shaped their rebellion? How did they maintain the will and energy to keep such an unwomanly struggle going for so long, and continuing still?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Memoirs and responses by Kate Millett, Vivian Gornick, Michele Wallace, Alix Kates Shulman, Joan Nestle, Jo Freeman, Yvonne Rainer, Barbara Smith, Ellen Willis, and many more embody the excitement that fueled the movement and the conflicts that threatened it from within. These stories tell how the world we live in changed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>With <b>The Feminist Memoir Project</b>, these activists contribute to yet another movement project, the political work of memory.</p><p>As the editors assembled this collection of memoirs from feminism's "second wave" of the 1960s and '70s, they were lectured by a member of a younger feminist generation about the need to move forward. "It is time for the old to let go of '70s politics," she told them. "To practice a little strategic forgetfulness." Contrary to this stance, the editors see the history of feminism as a necessary building block for further activism. "Ignorance of that time ... is also an odd handicap," they write, "like running a relay race with no idea of what's being handed on to you from the runner just behind."<p> An impressive group of women tell stories that should inspire--and amuse--a younger generation. The widely published Chicana activist and writer Elizabeth Martinez writes about experiencing racism in the women's movement on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination; documentary photographer Paula Allen and writer Eve Ensler (most recently known for her acclaimed play <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>) recount falling into "activist love." Artist Nancy Spero recalls her first feminist action, in which several women crashed a stag party of eminent art critics in New York and covered the porn-watching men with pies.

The <i>Tracts for the Times</i> will always be connected with the Oxford Movement. John Henry Newman and other leaders of the movement sought a renewal of &#x201c;catholic,&#x201d; or Roman Catholic, thought and practice within the Church of England. They published their ideas on the theological, pastoral, and devotional problems that they perceived within the church in ninety "Tracts for the Times" (1833-1841). Newman, who edited the series, either wrote or compiled a third of the tracts. Increasingly, the tracts were expanded into treatises&#x2015;especially after Tract 36&#x2015;and were often composed of quotations from patristic writers and the English Divines. Tracts 83 and 85 are included in <i>Discussions and Arguments on Various Subjects, volume VII</i> of the Birmingham Oratory Millennium Edition of his works. Tracts 74, 76, and 88 have been omitted here.

But in the Soviet Union, where the ruling elites embraced, patronized, and even fetishized science like never before, scientists lived their lives on a knife edge. The Soviet Union had the best-funded scientific establishment in history. Scientists were elevated as popular heroes and lavished with awards and privileges. But if their ideas or their field of study lost favor with the elites, they could be exiled, imprisoned, or murdered. And yet they persisted, making major contributions to 20th century science.<br><br><i>Stalin and the Scientists</i> tells the story of the many gifted scientists who worked in Russia from the years leading up to the Revolution through the death of the Great Scientist&#x201d; himself, Joseph Stalin. It weaves together the stories of scientists, politicians, and ideologues into an intimate and sometimes horrifying portrait of a state determined to remake the world. They often wreaked great harm. Stalin was himself an amateur botanist, and by falling under the sway of dangerous charlatans like Trofim Lysenko (who denied the existence of genes), and by relying on antiquated ideas of biology, he not only destroyed the lives of hundreds of brilliant scientists, he caused the death of millions through famine.<br><br>But from atomic physics to management theory, and from radiation biology to neuroscience and psychology, these Soviet experts also made breakthroughs that forever changed agriculture, education, and medicine. A masterful book that deepens our understanding of Russian history, <i>Stalin and the Scientists</i> is a great achievement of research and storytelling, and a gripping look at what happens when science falls prey to politics.</p><p><b>Simon Ings,</b> a science writer and novelist, is the author of <i>A Natural History of Seeing: The Art and Science of Vision</i>.

He lives and works in London.The controversies over genetics came to a head at the fourth annual session of the Lenin Academy, that vast conglomerate of all things agricultural. The organizers of the session, which ran from December 19 to 26, 1936, had never planned it to be some kind of extra-judicial venue to try genetics. Nicolai Ivanovich Muralov, the new head of the Lenin Academy, tried to maintain an even-handed debate. Muralov&#x2019;s reputation was one of warmth and fairness&#x2015;but he was in serious trouble. Trotsky had been his friend and champion. That sort of affiliation was by now quite enough to get a person killed.<br> <br> There was another problem with Muralov&#x2015;one which came to shape the Lenin Academy&#x2019;s session in a way that sent a chill through Vavilov and the field of genetics: Muralov knew nothing whatsoever about genetics.</p><h2>Behavior Adjustment Training: BAT for Fear, Frustration, and Aggression in Dogs</h2><p>Please note that this is the out of date version of the BAT book.

How did the Indian people of Mesoamerica in the 14th century come to believe that their god, Quetzalcoatl, was crucified in A.D. 30 and resurrected three days later. How could Joseph Smith have known in the 1820s that at least three huge volcanoes in Mexico and El Salvador each erupted with gigantic destructive lava and ash that buried several cities at the time of the Savior&#39;s crucifixion? Why do the ancient sacred books of Mesoamerica reflect knowledge of the Old Testament? How did the ancient people of Mesoamerica as early as the third century B.C. have a very similar Tree of Life as found in the Old World? The answers to these questions, and many more, are explained in the pages of this book. The evidence is conclusive, even overwhelming - connecting the Book of Mormon to recent scientific discoveries in Mesoamerica.</p><p></p><h2>Philippe Halsman, a Retrospective: Photographs from the Halsman Family Collection</h2><p>From inside dust jacket: One of the greatest portrait photographers of this century, Philippe Halsman is celebrated in this long-awaited retrospective.

Whether looking surprised or carefully posed, celebrities have the visual control of themselves and how they look down to a science. This large, aggressive book of sometimes astonishing, sometimes quiet photographs shows the generous archive of black-and-white celebrity shots left to us by Philippe Halsman (1906?79). Halsman brought originality, respect, and confidence to his work. What's missing here is Halsman himself getting his self-conscious subjects to leap or slouch or sneer or bask in their own glory; whether or not we admire the work of this incredibly gifted photographer, we can't help but appreciate his ability to reveal the people he shot.

Scattered across these books are deeply personal sketches of his wife and studies of the human figure, grand landscape studies, and evidence of the development and maturation of Diebenkorn's signature approaches to figuration and abstraction. Taken together, these sketchbooks offer a nearly complete look at his career, from his twenties to the years just before his death at age seventy. He added to these sketchbooks throughout his life, routinely putting one down only to pick it up again years later, and their improvised nature ensures that each turn of the page offers a surprise. <i>Richard Diebenkorn: The Sketchbooks Revealed</i> provides a unique look into this previously inaccessible trove of images. All twenty-nine sketchbooks are represented, including one reproduced in its entirety. More than 500 full color images show off stunning gestural sketches and glimpses of the artist's lived experiences. Essays by Enrique Chagoya, Alexander Nemerov, Peggy Phelan, and Steven A. Nash offer insights in to the artist's career, working process, and the visual dialogues Diebenkorn forged with fellow artists past and present. And Gretchen Diebenkorn Grant contributes a remembrance of her father and his artistry. This extraordinary collection of Richard Diebenkorn's sketches is unprecedented in displaying an artist's process, and through the collection we can better understand Diebenkorn's style of working. Presented together in this book, the sketchbooks become a revelation of sorts, offering intimate access to the practice of a well-known, important, and prolific artist.</p><p>This book is published to accompany an exhibition of the sketchbooks at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University.

Yet they were nearly the same age and almost the same size, and they came to New York at the same time. They possessed virtually the same talents and played the same position. They were both products of generations of baseball-playing families, for whom the game was the only escape from a lifetime of brutal manual labor. Both were nearly crushed by the weight of the outsized expectations placed on them, first by their families and later by America. Both lived secret lives far different from those their fans knew. What their fans also didn't know was that the two men shared a close personal friendship--and that each was the only man who could truly understand the other's experience.</p><p>ALLEN BARRA is the author of <i>Inventing Wyatt Earp</i>, <i>The Last Coach</i>, and <i>Yogi Berra</i>, as well as several essay collections. He is a regular contributor to such publications as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Daily Beast</i>, and <i>Salon</i>.1<br><br>Fathers and Sons<br><br>If a scientific research team were to conduct an exhaustive study of the ideal places, times, and conditions for breeding the perfect baseball player, they&#x2019;d surely come up with something very close to Westfield, Alabama, in the heart of Birmingham&#x2019;s steel industry, or the mining district of Commerce, Oklahoma.<br><br>Thousands of southern blacks left their homes during the Depression and moved to industrial cities in the North, but in Westfield, Alabama, William Howard &#x201c;Cat&#x201d; Mays chose to stay home. Grueling as the work in the local steel mills was, Cat understood that the promise of a better life in towns like Gary, Indiana, Flint, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was remote. He stayed in Alabama. At the same time, countless families from Oklahoma and adjoining states made the decision to abandon everything and make the hazardous trek to California; their stories would be told in prose by John Steinbeck and in song by Woody Guthrie. No one spoke for Elvin Charles &#x201c;Mutt&#x201d; Mantle, who chose to keep his family in Oklahoma, taking jobs as a road grader, tenant farmer, and, finally, miner to put food on the table.<br><br>For both Cat Mays and Mutt Mantle, the main recreation&#x2014;practically the only one&#x2014;was baseball, specifically the industrial league baseball organized by their companies. They raised their boys in a baseball culture. No fathers ever guided their sons toward professional baseball with more single-mindedness than Cat and Mutt. Both men saw baseball as a way to get their sons out of those small towns, out of the mills and mines, although they guided them in very different ways. And once Mickey and Willie left, neither ever lived in his hometown again.<br><br>Willie Howard Mays&#x2014;why he was not named William like his father has never been explained&#x2014;was born in Westfield on May 6, 1931. There&#x2019;s no monument or plaque to mark the spot; little of the Westfield that Willie knew remains standing today. A pamphlet printed by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce in the 1960s called it a &#x201c;village,&#x201d; which is inaccurate&#x2014;Westfield was never a village or a town, but a community of neighborhoods populated by black working-class families whose lifeline was the steel mills in nearby Fairfield. Virtually all the houses were of the type called &#x201c;shotgun&#x201d;&#x2014;it was said that you could fire a shotgun at the front door and the pellets would go out the back door. They were built and owned by mills such as the Tennessee Cast Iron and Railroad Company (TCI), the great subcorporation of U.S. Steel, officially to &#x201c;benefit&#x201d; the workers but in reality to maintain their dependence on their employers.<br><br>The larger town of Fairfield provided necessary services&#x2014;such as schools&#x2014;to the small nearby communities like Westfield. Fairfield was born in 1910, the same year that nearby Rickwood Field opened, and it was a planned community from the start, the result of U.S. Steel&#x2019;s purchase of TCI.<br><br>Years later in his autobiography, Jackie Robinson, criticizing Willie for his lack of involvement in the civil rights movement, would remind Mays of his roots: &#x201c;I hope Willie hasn&#x2019;t forgotten his shotgun house in Birmingham slums, wind-whistling through its clapboards, as he sits in his $85,000 mansion in San Francisco&#x2019;s fashionable Forest Hills, or the concentration camp atmosphere of the Shacktown of his boyhood.&#x201d; 1<br><br>The house Willie grew up in was fairly standard for families of black steelworkers, and not terribly unlike those of most white steelworkers in the Birmingham area. In fact, it was not a great deal different from the house of a zinc miner in Commerce, Oklahoma, where Mickey Mantle grew up. Some might have rated the Mays home as superior: an early Mays biography describes the house he grew up in as &#x201c;middle class.&#x201d; 2 It&#x2019;s doubtful anyone would have said that to describe the Mantles&#x2019; house in Commerce; Cat&#x2019;s family had little money, but his house had electricity, which the Mantle home did not.<br><br>Today some of the neighborhoods in and around Westfield are in ruin. All that&#x2019;s left of most of the original company houses is their foundations. The population has been shrinking steadily for decades, from perhaps 5,000 when Willie was born to just over 1,100 in 1990 and under 1,000 today. The steel industry that sustained these communities began deserting the Birmingham area in the late 1970s, and the industrial baseball leagues that produced Willie Mays were gone at least two decades before that.<br><br>The black population of Alabama yielded many fine baseball players, among them perhaps the game&#x2019;s greatest pitcher, Satchel Paige; the leading home run hitter of the twentieth century, Henry Aaron; and arguably the greatest all-around player in the game&#x2019;s history, Willie Mays. The greatest concentration of black baseball talent in the country was in the South, and in the South no state produced as many Negro League players as Alabama; in Alabama the preponderance of talent came from the industrial leagues of the Birmingham area.<br><br>Mays grew up in a baseball tradition that was more than half a century old when he was born. Baseball had been introduced to the Deep South after 1865 by Confederate soldiers who had learned the game either from their Union captors in prison camps or during breaks when men from the two armies would get together for some R&amp;R before they resumed slaughtering one another. How the game came to be popular with southern blacks is a subject on which historians are split. Some say that free blacks learned it from their former masters. Others suggest that black soldiers in the Union Army, who numbered perhaps 200,000, picked it up from their white comrades. Yet a third possibility is that blacks watched white men play, then went home and played it themselves. It&#x2019;s likely that all three factors had a role.<br><br>The father of black ball in Alabama was a man named Charles Isam Taylor, who went to Birmingham from South Carolina in 1904. A veteran of the U.S. Army and the Spanish-American War, Taylor worked his way through Clark College in Atlanta, where he helped organize the school&#x2019;s first baseball team. For four years, Taylor made a living by staging and promoting (and sometimes playing in) baseball games for Birmingham&#x2019;s black fans. In 1910, realizing that there was more money to be made above the Mason-Dixon Line (where black teams could be matched against white teams), Taylor moved his team to the industrial town of West Baden, Indiana. The fans were heartbroken, and at least one black newspaper, the Birmingham Reporter, continued to print items about their games, passing on information about the local lads who were playing ball so far from home. From there, Taylor fades into obscurity, but his brainchild of using the industrial leagues as a talent farm for a professional league lived on and flourished.<br><br>If there was one progressive aspect to the steel and coal barons who dominated Birmingham industry, it was that they saw the value of sponsoring baseball teams among the black as well as the white workforces. Baseball provided great exercise and improved morale enormously, and shirts with company names and logos proved to be cheap but effective advertising.<br><br>Lorenzo &#x201c;Piper&#x201d; Davis, the most important figure in Birmingham black ball history, was Willie Mays&#x2019;s mentor and first manager. He told me in 1987, &#x201c;There is a lot to be said about the way the companies treated us. It was the closest thing a black man could get to a square deal. They paid for bats and gloves and uniforms, and they even paid for our travel expenses to go play other company teams.&#x201d; 3<br><br>Davis, of course, was speaking of a time in the late 1930s and early 1940s when the Birmingham steel industry, shaking off the Depression, was booming again, but from the years before World War I until the early 1950s, when a combination of factors ranging from the civil rights struggle to televised major league baseball eroded support for both the Negro Leagues and white minor leagues, Birmingham could lay claim to being the baseball capital of the South.<br><br>Allen Harvey Woodward, known to his friends for reasons no one can remember as &#x201c;Rick,&#x201d; was one of the big reasons. Rick was the son of steel baron Joseph Hersey Woodward and, despite his father&#x2019;s indifference, was an enthusiastic supporter of Woodward Iron&#x2019;s company team. In 1909 he made a daring move&#x2014;supervising the construction of the first steel-and-concrete ballpark in the South. Rickwood Field, named in a radio contest and combining the owner&#x2019;s nickname with the first part of his last name, became the home of a team called the Birmingham Barons, named for the coal and steel magnates who ran Birmingham. It would also be home, beginning in the early 1920s, to the Black Barons, who played on alternate Sundays and other days when the white team was traveling.<br><br>Rickwood Field opened on August 18, 1910. It was largely modeled after Shibe Park in Philadelphia, home of Connie Mack&#x2019;s champion A&#x2019;s&#x2014;Mack himself came to Birmingham to advise Woodward on construction details&#x2014;while also incorporating elements of Pittsburgh&#x2019;s Forbes Field and Cincinnati&#x2019;s Crosley Field (still known in 1910 as &#x201c;Palace of the Fans&#x201d;), ballparks that Willie Mays would still be performing in more than half a century later. Rickwood, which stands today as the oldest ballpark in the country, was for decades the crown jewel of southern baseball. It was as if history wanted to provide Willie Mays with a worthy stage from which to launch his legend.<br><br>Willie Mays would become the favorite ballplayer of New York&#x2019;s liberal-leaning sportswriters, but there was a conservative streak in him that the writers never acknowledged. He came by it naturally enough. His father was named for William Howard Taft, who was president in 1912, the year Cat was born. Many blacks in Alabama, like blacks throughout the South, supported the racially progressive Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft. When the party turned more conservative, they continued to support it if only because most of the local political machines were controlled by white Democrats.<br><br>Birmingham after World War II would become one of the hotbeds of black civil rights activism, particularly when black GIs returned from the war. But there were pockets of the black population outside the city who did not easily understand or quickly respond to the call for civil rights. Willie Mays was raised in such neighborhoods, first in Westfield and then later a few miles away in Fairfield. When Willie was born, most black families in Westfield and the surrounding areas didn&#x2019;t have roots there. They had come there for jobs in the mills and foundries, which had sprung up only in the late 1890s. Black mine and mill workers came to enjoy a certain autonomy and created a life for themselves less dehumanizing than was possible in much of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and even South Alabama, where there weren&#x2019;t many opportunities for blacks other than picking cotton, lumber sharecropping, and truck farming.<br><br>Because of the steel and coal industry, most of the black communities to the south and west of Birmingham were more or less self-sufficient and in most ways independent of the city. They had schools, churches, restaurants, and even movie theaters that were black-owned and -operated (though the movie houses got the films only after they had run in the white theaters). On Saturday afternoons, when there was a nickel to spare, young Willie would see the B-movie Westerns he loved so much and get to fantasize that he too would someday be a cowboy like Hoot Gibson, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, or Johnny Mack Brown, who had been a football star at the Univer-sity of Alabama in the mid-1920s and became a national celebrity when the Crimson Tide won the 1926 Rose Bowl. At the same time, Mickey Mantle sat in all-white theaters in Commerce, Oklahoma, thrilling to the same celluloid cowboys, including Oklahoma&#x2019;s own Tom Mix.<br><br>Willie&#x2019;s father Cat&#x2014;or sometimes &#x201c;Kitty Cat&#x201d; (or &#x201c;Kat&#x201d; with a &#x201c;K&#x201d; in early writings on Willie)&#x2014;was, in the words of Charles Einstein, &#x201c;a small bouncy, Buddha-tummied figure.&#x201d; 4 His nickname came from his reflexes&#x2014;his teammates always admired the way he broke immediately in the right direction on fly balls&#x2014;and the way he sprang out of the batter&#x2019;s box on bunts. William Howard Mays learned his baseball from his father, Walter, who had been a sharecropper in Tuscaloosa and was a pretty fair country pitcher. &#x201c;It went from him through me,&#x201d; said Cat, &#x201c;and to the third generation, my own son. And they say the third generation is it.&#x201d; 5<br><br>During Willie&#x2019;s formative years, Cat worked in the &#x201c;spike and bolt&#x201d; shop of TCI and starred for its company team, just one of several organized teams he played for before and after the war. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d play for anybody who&#x2019;d give you money,&#x201d; he told Charles Einstein, &#x201c;because every time somebody came to get me to play baseball, I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t go, man&#x2014;I got something to do,&#x2019; and he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Come on, man, I&#x2019;ll give you $2.50.&#x2019; Sometimes when things was bad, you&#x2019;d have to go for ten cent [sic] a game. And for that money you learned baseball. You know, I used to study the pitchers when I got on first base &#x2019;cause I could bunt my way on, and if I got on first base it was like getting a double. And to me, from second base to third base was much easier than from first to second.&#x201d; 6<br><br>Sometime in 1930, Cat, maybe while picking up some spending money on a traveling ball team, met Annie Satterwhite. Annie was sixteen when Willie was born, but she and Cat never married. Her mother had been dead for several years, and sometime before that her father had abandoned the family. Not much is known about Annie, and Willie talked little about her in his adult years. Shortly after his birth, he was given over to the women he would call his aunts, his mother&#x2019;s younger sisters: Sarah, thirteen, and Ernestine&#x2014;or &#x201c;Steen,&#x201d; as Willie called her&#x2014;just nine.<br><br>Or at least that&#x2019;s the story Willie told numerous writers. The truth may be a great deal stranger. Willie never addressed the question of why his mother, who settled down near Westfield after she married a man named Frank McMorris, never brought him to live with her. Moreover, the true identities of Ernestine and Sarah have never been established. In the earliest books on Willie, the girls are said to be Annie&#x2019;s younger sisters, as they are in James Hirsch&#x2019;s massive 2010 biography: &#x201c;As a baby, he was given to his mother&#x2019;s two younger sisters, 13-year-old Sarah and 9-year-old Ernestine, who were his principal caretakers and who called him &#x2018;Junior.&#x2019; &#x201d; Sarah was &#x201c;the most important female figure in the boy&#x2019;s life, a role she played even after Willie left Alabama to play for the Giants.&#x201d; The makeshift family, writes Hirsch, &#x201c;expanded to include two more children born out of wedlock, one from Sarah and one from Ernestine. Both women later married, Sarah to Cat&#x2019;s cousin, Edgar May, who at some point lost the &#x2018;s&#x2019; on his last name (or perhaps Cat Mays&#x2019;s family added the &#x2018;s&#x2019;). Sarah May ended up raising her sister&#x2019;s son while married to his father&#x2019;s cousin.&#x201d; 7</p><h2>The Murder Stone</h2><p><p>A brilliant, big, old-fashioned drawing-room mystery with a denouement worthy of Agatha Christie, from the international bestseller.</p><p>Wealthy, cultured and respectable, the Finney family is the epitome of gentility.

Indeed, the sea in literature is as liquid and as volatile as the sea in life, shaping itself anew for every writer and every generation. For Addison and Burke, it was the realm of the sublime, of "foaming billows and floating mountains," of agreeable horror." For Romantics such as Turner, it was pure, unpent nature at its wildest and most magnificent, and for Coleridge, a mysterious and hallucinogenic place. And if for Melville it was a bountiful sea of metaphor, for Ben Franklin it was devoid of metaphor but teeming with natural wonders, curiosities, and lessons.<br> Truly the source of eternal fascination, the sea is one of the enduring subjects of literature, and certainly the most protean. Now, inveterate sailor and bestselling author of <em>Hunting Mister Heartbreak</em>, Jonathan Rabam, has compiled a remarkable anthology of our changing visions of the sea, a rich treasury of writings as varied and enthralling as the ocean itself. Arranged chronologically, and spanning everything from Anglo-Saxon poetry to modern oceanography, these excerpts capture the work of poets, novelists, scientists, explorers, in a collection that blends the practical with the beautiful, the comic with the terrifying. Readers can savor Samuel Eliot Morison's picture of October spring tides on the coast of Maine, "when the blueberry bushes on top of the granite cliffs turn a brilliant crimson and the maple near shore sends up torches of gold and scarlet among the evergreen, all reflected in the quiet waters." Or James Boswell's intimate portrait of Samuel Johnson below deck, "lying in philosophical tranquillity, with a greyhound of Col's at his back, keeping him warm." Or Dickens' comic memoir of being seasick on a rolling deck ("I found myself standing...holding on to something. I don't know what. I think it was the boatswain: or it may have been the pump: or possibly the cow").<br> Those who love nature writing will find that Raban includes a wide selection, such as Darwin's account of the <em>Beagle</em> surging through a glimmering, phosphorescent nighttime sea, Rachel Carson's explanation of the color of the sea, and David Lewis's discovery that Pacific islanders navigate more by feel than by sight, by the roll and pitch of their vessels as they corkscrew over the waves. And for everyone who loves great writing, Raban includes not only passages from the great sea classics--such as <em>Moby Dick, The Old Man and the Sea,</em> and <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em>--but also lesser-known gems by writers such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Elizabeth Bishop, E.B. White, Emily Dickinson, and John Barth.<br> Whether you love Darwin or Rachel Carson, Joseph Conrad or Robert Lowell, <em>The Oxford Book of the Sea</em> is as bountiful and alluring as its subject. For everyone interested in the sea, from sailors and beachcombers to armchair voyagers, and for everyone drawn to fine writing, this book is an excursion you won't want to miss.</p><p>Jonathan Raban's anthology <i>The Oxford Book of the Sea</i> is just that: a collection of writings about the sea--not about voyages or naval battles, or fishing or swimming, but rather passages that define the water itself. Open the book to any page and you'll find descriptions of the sea in all its infinite variability. Benjamin Franklin writes: "The water is now visibly changed.... Abundance of dolphins are about us...;" H.M. Tomlinson describes a storm thus: "In the early afternoon the waves had assumed serious proportions. They soared by us in broad, somber ranges, with hissing white ridges, an inhospitable and subduing sight." Even Jane Austen has something to say about the sea: "The terrific grandeur of the ocean in a storm, its glassy surface in a calm, its gulls and its samphire, and the deep fathoms of its abysses, its quick vicissitudes, its direful deceptions..." Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and John Milton are just a few of the contributors to this magnificent paean to the sea. <p> This is a book meant to be sampled and savored in small bites. Read a poem here, a letter there, an excerpt from <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Rabbit at Rest</i>, or a few lines from a diary entry. The collection spans nearly 1,000 years of the English-speaking world's experience of the sea; in all that time it has lost none of its power to enchant, inspire, and terrify. <i>The Oxford Book of the Sea</i> is a terrific read for seafarers and landlubbers alike.</p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br><strong>Jonathan Raban</strong> is an acclaimed novelist and travel writer whose books include <em>Hunting Mister Heartbreak, Coasting, Old Glory</em>, and <em>Foreign Land</em>. and<br></p><h2>Japanese Pilgrimage</h2><p>Describes the route of a Buddhist pilgrimage through the Shikoku region of Japan in honor of an eighth-century priest and includes information about Japanese folklore</p><p></p><h2>Caravaggio: Painter of Miracles (Eminent Lives)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Matching gorgeous prose to gorgeous artworks, Prose responds to each image as a moment of theatrical revelation, sensual or spiritual, and frequently both.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Boston Sunday Globe</strong></em></p><p>In&nbsp;<em>Caravaggio, New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author Francine Prose offers an enthralling account of the life and work of one of the greatest painters of all time.

He spent his last years in exile, in Naples, Malta, and Sicily, at once celebrated for his art and tormented by his enemies. Through it all, he produced masterpieces of astonishing complexity and power.

Now, twenty-five years later, he goes back to that country, returning to the places he visited years ago and talking to people of all types and at all levels of society. Naipaul started writing in 1954 he has won the John Llewelyn Rhys Memorial Prize, the Somerset Maugham Award, the Hawthornden Prize, the W.H.Smith Award and the Booker Prize, the latter with the novel &#34;In a Free State&#34; (1971). His most recently published novels are &#34;Guerrillas&#34; (1975) and &#34;A Bend in the River&#34; (1979). He is the author of two books about India, &#34;An Area of Darkness&#34; (1964) and &#34;India: A Wounded Civilization&#34; (1977); his other well-known works of non-fiction are &#34;The Return of Eva Peron&#34; with &#34;The Killings in Trinidad&#34; (1981); &#34;Finding the Centre&#34; (1984); and &#34;A Turn in the South&#34; (1989), which is about South America and was shortlisted for the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award in 1990.</p><p>In 1975, at the height of Indira Gandhi&#39;s Emergency, V. S. Naipaul returned to India, the country his ancestors had left one hundred years before.

Put more bluntly, he was an asshole, an SOB, or whatever epithet best describes an abrasive egomaniac. In this colorful profile of the great man--warts and all--astronomer Florian Freistetter shows why this damning assessment is inescapable.Newton&#39;s hatred of fellow scientist Robert Hooke knew no bounds and he was strident in expressing it. He stole the work of colleague John Flamsteed, ruining his career without a second thought. He carried on a venomous battle with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the invention of calculus, vilifying him anonymously while the German scientist was alive and continuing the attacks after he died. All evidence indicates that Newton was conniving, sneaky, resentful, secretive, and antisocial. Compounding the mystery of his strange character is that he was also a religious fanatic, a mystery-monger who spent years studying the Bible and predicted the apocalypse.While documenting all of these unusual traits, the author makes a convincing case that Newton would have never revolutionized physics if he hadn&#39;t been just such an obnoxious person. This is a fascinating character study of an astounding genius and--if truth be told--an almighty asshole as well.</p><p><b>Florian Freistetter</b> is an award-winning freelance science journalist and the author of several popular-science books on astronomy, including <i>Stephen Hawking: His Science in a Nutshell</i>. He has also published more than five thousand articles on his blog, <i>Astrodicticum Simplex</i>, one of the most-read German-language science blogs, and he writes a weekly column about mathematics for spektrum.de, as well as many other articles for various publications. Since 2015, he has produced and performed in humorous popular-science presentations in theaters in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland and on the television show <i>Science Busters</i>. Having previously taught astronomy at the University of Heidelberg, Jena, and Vienna, he now hosts <i>Sternengeschichten</i> ("Star Stories"), a weekly podcast on astronomy.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day in the year 1642. Or on January 4 in the year 1643. It depends entirely on which calendar you consult&#x2014;and the fact that there were two different calendars in use back then is evidence enough of the confused times in which the man who would later reinvent the universe was born. It was high time for a genius to appear and shed light on the world, and Isaac Newton was that very genius. And an asshole to boot.<br> &nbsp;<br> People generally think of Newton as the man who almost singlehandedly founded the modern physical sciences, as the scientist whose work forms the basis of practically all branches of the natural sciences, as the person who gave us a completely new perspective of the universe. All of that is absolutely true. And yet Isaac Newton was also a selfish and belligerent bully. I don&#x2019;t say that because I have anything against the man. On the contrary&#x2014;my own work as an astronomer is dominated by Newton&#x2019;s achievements. Without Newton, none of the things I have found out in the course of my astronomic research would have been possible. I worship Newton more than almost any other scientist of the past&#x2014;even though he was such a jerk.<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, to a small degree, I admire him precisely because he was so horrible. Does that sound strange to you? A contradiction in terms? It&#x2019;s to do with the fact that, in the modern world of science, the most important thing is to stick to the social and political rules of the research apparatchiks and to behave in an opportune fashion. Otherwise, you&#x2019;ll never have a successful career. So there simply couldn&#x2019;t be somebody like Newton today&#x2014;a person who seems to delight in making enemies his whole life long and yet still manages to revolutionize the world of science. Or perhaps there could. Can a genius and asshole be a role model for a successful scientist even today?<br> &nbsp;<br> Isaac Newton was the guy with the apple and gravity, as most people probably know. But his achievements went much further than that. There was practically no subject that he left untouched, so it&#x2019;s worth taking a closer look at his work. But the same is true of his fascinating character: he was odd, unfriendly, uncompromising, extremely sure of himself, resentful, argumentative, secretive, insensitive, underhanded, and a religious fanatic who liked to prophesy the end of the world. But&#x2014;and this is the most interesting point&#x2014;if he hadn&#x2019;t been all of that, he most likely wouldn&#x2019;t have been in a position to change the world in the way he did.<br> &nbsp;<br> Newton is a man from another time. His scientific achievements, however, have survived up until the present day and will continue to be valid in the future. The natural world can still be explained using the laws that he established back then. In this book, which makes no claim to be a comprehensive biography&#x2014;if we wanted to understand Newton&#x2019;s life and work as fully as is possible some three hundred years after his death, we would have to write entire libraries of books, which experts in the past have indeed done (see, for example, the recommended reading at the end of this book)&#x2014;I take a look at the way in which Newton treated himself and his fellow human beings, complete with all the disputes, absurd decisions, and bizarre episodes, which find no mention in the usual physics text books.<br> &nbsp;<br> Newton was a strange and awkward chap from the very beginning. &#x201c;What shall become of me? I will make an end of it. I can only weep. I do not know what to do.&#x201d; He wrote these depressing lines in his notebook while still a youth. After a not particularly happy childhood, he saw no prospect of a happier life as an adult. His father had died before his birth, and his mother remarried when Isaac was three years old. The child seemed to be viewed as a nuisance for the young couple and was sent off to live with his grandmother. At school, he was cleverer by some distance than his classmates, which only served to heighten his sense of isolation.<br> &nbsp;<br> A list of all Newton&#x2019;s &#x201c;sins,&#x201d; as written later, at the age of nineteen, in his notebook, gives an indication of his relationship with his family and other people in general. When he writes that he was guilty of &#x201c;peevishness with my mother,&#x201d; that&#x2019;s understandable. Entries like &#x201c;Stealing cherry cobs from Eduard Storer&#x201d; or &#x201c;Calling Dorothy Rose a jade&#x201d; also sound like things that youngsters are prone to do, just as pretty much every boy has at some point had &#x201c;unclean thoughts words and actions and dreams.&#x201d; &#x201c;Making pies on Sunday night&#x201d; or &#x201c;Making a mousetrap on Sunday&#x201d; are no longer considered misdeeds today, though they obviously lay heavy on Newton&#x2019;s heart. But some entries provide a deeper insight into his character: &#x201c;Wishing death and hoping it to some&#x201d; or &#x201c;Striking many.&#x201d; And by the time we read &#x201c;Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them,&#x201d; it is clear that Isaac Newton&#x2019;s head was full of thoughts that have no place in a normal childhood and youth.<br> &nbsp;<br> It follows that Newton preferred to focus on the physical world around him than on other people. He was fascinated by machines, constructed water mills, and observed how, when light passed through tiny holes in the wall of his attic bedroom, the sun&#x2019;s course could be measured with the rays of light. He then made sundials that were so accurate that the family he lived with during his school days used them to tell the time. When Isaac was sixteen, his mother&#x2014;now a widow once more&#x2014;summoned him back home to take over the family&#x2019;s farming activities, which ran completely contrary to his interests.<br> &nbsp;<br> Farming was not one of Newton&#x2019;s fortes. He might have been better at it if he had had any interest at all in the work. But even then, he was above all a difficult, selfish, and childish young man&#x2014;one who had no desire for tough physical activity. Fortunately for him and for science, however, his uncle and his former teacher were able to convince Isaac&#x2019;s mother to allow him to attend the University of Cambridge.<br> &nbsp;<br> In June 1661, Newton left his home village of Woolsthorpe in the county of Lincolnshire and set off for the university. There, he began the work that would shake the foundations of the world as it was then and whose effects can still be felt today. There, he also began the next stage of the development of his character, such that we can say in hindsight, &#x201c;What a scientific genius! And what an asshole!&#x201d;</p><h2>Cutting Edges: Making Sense of the Eighties</h2><p>Krauthammer&#39;s musings on cold war gamesmanship, psychiatry, and the Reagan Administration.</p><p>Most of the 40 essays in this collection originally appeared in the New Republic , where Krauthammer is a contributing editor, and the Washington Post , for which he writes a weekly syndicated political column. Krauthammer's observations on such subjects as AIDS, abortion, Baby Fae, Star Wars, Bitburg, Nicaragua, Geraldine Ferraro, and Mario Cuomo are usually pungent, lucid, and polished.

John began writing Ranger&#x2019;s Apprentice for his son, Michael, ten years ago, and is still hard at work on the series and its spinoff, Brotherband Chronicles. He currently lives in the suburb of Manly, Australia, with his wife. In addition to their son, they have two grown daughters and four grandsons.CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>It had been a poor harvest in Scanlon Estate. The wheat crop had been meagre at best, and the apple orchards had been savaged by a blight that left three-quarters of the fruit blemished and rotting on the trees.<br><br>As a result, the share farmers, farm labourers, orchardists and fruit pickers were facing hard times, with three months before the next harvest, during which time they would have nowhere near enough to eat.<br><br>Squire Dennis of Scanlon Manor was a kind-hearted man. He was also a practical one and, while his kind-hearted nature urged him to help his needy tenants, his practical side recognised such an action as good business. If his farmers and labourers went hungry, chances were they would move away, in search of work in a less stricken region. Then, when good times returned to Scanlon Estate, there would be insufficient workers available to reap the harvest.<br><br>Dennis had acquired considerable wealth over the years and could ride out the hard times ahead. But he knew that such an option wasn&#x2019;t available to his workers. Accordingly, he decided to invest some of his accumulated wealth in them. He set up a workers&#x2019; kitchen, which he paid for himself, and opened it to the needy who lived on his estate. In that way, he ensured that his people received at least one good meal a day. It was nothing fancy &#x2013; usually a soup, or a porridge made from oats. But it was hot and nourishing and filling and he was confident that the cost would be more than repaid by the continuing loyalty of his tenants and labourers.<br>The kitchen was in the parkland in front of the manor house. It consisted of rows of trestle tables and benches, and a large serving table. These were sheltered from the worst of the weather by canvas awnings stretched over poles above them, creating a large marquee. The sides were left open. In bad weather, this often meant that the wind and rain blew around the tables. But farm folk are of hardy stock and the arrangement was far better than eating in the open.<br>In point of fact, kitchen was a misnomer. All the cooking was done in the vast kitchen inside the manor house, and the food was carried out to be served to the hungry tenants and their families. The estate workers understood that the food was provided free of charge. But it was a matter of principle that any who could afford a small payment would do so. Most often, this was in the form of a few copper coins, or of produce &#x2013; a brace of rabbits or a wild duck taken at the pond.<br>The kitchen operated for the two hours leading up to dusk, ensuring that the workers could enjoy a night&#x2019;s sleep without the gnawing pains of hunger in their bellies.<br>It was almost dusk when the stranger pushed his way through to the serving table.<br><br>He was a big man with shoulder-length dirty blond hair. He was wearing a wagoner&#x2019;s leather vest, and a pair of thick gauntlets were tucked into his belt, alongside the scabbard that held a heavy-bladed dagger. His eyes darted continually from side to side, never remaining long in one spot, giving him a hunted look.<br>Squire Dennis&#x2019;s chief steward, who was in charge of the serving table, looked at him suspiciously. The workers&#x2019; kitchen was intended for locals, not for travellers, and he&#x2019;d never seen this man before.<br><br>&#x2018;What do you want?&#x2019; he asked, his tone less than friendly.<br><br>The wagoner stopped his darting side-to-side looks for a few seconds and focused on the man facing him. He was about to bluster and threaten but the steward was a heavily built man, and there were two powerful-looking servants behind him, obviously tasked with keeping order. He nodded at the cauldron of thick soup hanging over the fire behind the serving table.<br><br>&#x2018;I want food,&#x2019; he said roughly. &#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t eaten all day.&#x2019;<br><br>The steward frowned. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re welcome to soup, but you&#x2019;ll have to pay,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Free food is for estate tenants and workers only.&#x2019;<br><br>The wagoner scowled at him, but he reached into a grubby purse hanging from his belt and rummaged around. The steward heard the jingle of coins as he sorted through the contents, letting some drop back into the purse. He deposited three pennigs on the table.<br><br>&#x2018;That do?&#x2019; he challenged. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve got.&#x2019;<br><br>The steward raised a disbelieving eyebrow. He&#x2019;d heard the jingle of coins dropping back into the purse. But it had been a long day and he couldn&#x2019;t be bothered with a confrontation. Best to give the man some food and get rid of him as soon as possible. He gestured to the serving girl by the soup vat.<br><br>&#x2018;Give him a bowl,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>She dumped a healthy portion into a wooden bowl and set it before him, adding a hunk of crusty bread.<br><br>The wagoner looked at the tables around him. Many of those seated were drinking noggins of ale as well. There was nothing unusual in that. Ale was relatively cheap and the squire had decided that his people shouldn&#x2019;t have a dry meal. There was a cask behind the serving table, with ale dripping slowly from its spigot. The wagoner nodded towards it.<br><br>&#x2018;What about ale?&#x2019; he demanded.<br><br>The steward drew himself up a little straighter. He didn&#x2019;t like the man&#x2019;s manner. He might be paying for his meal, but it was a paltry amount and he was getting good value for his money.<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;ll cost extra,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Two pennigs more.&#x2019;<br><br>Grumbling, the wagoner rummaged in his purse again. He showed no sign of embarrassment at producing more coins after claiming that he had none. He tossed them on the table and the steward nodded to one of his men.<br><br>&#x2018;Give him a noggin,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>The wagoner took his soup, bread and ale and turned away without another word.<br><br>&#x2018;And thank you,&#x2019; the steward said sarcastically, but the blond man ignored him. He threaded his way through the tables, studying the faces of those sitting there. The steward watched him go. The wagoner was obviously looking for someone and, equally obviously, hoping not to see him.<br><br>The servant who had drawn the ale stepped close to him and said in a lowered voice, &#x2018;He looks like trouble waiting to happen.&#x2019;<br><br>The steward nodded. &#x2018;Best let him eat and be on his way. Don&#x2019;t give him any extra, even if he offers to pay.&#x2019;<br><br>The serving man grunted assent, then turned as a farmer and his family approached the table, hopefully looking at the soup cauldron.<br><br>&#x2018;Step up, Jem. Let&#x2019;s give you and your family something to stick your ribs together, eh?&#x2019;<br><br>Holding his soup bowl and ale high to avoid bumping them against the people seated at the tables, the wagoner made his way to the very rear of the marquee, close by the sandstone walls of the great manor house. He sat at the last table, on his own, facing the front, where he could see each new arrival as they entered the big open tent. He began to eat, but with his eyes constantly flicking up to watch the front of the tent, he managed to spill and dribble a good amount of the soup down his beard and the front of his clothes.<br><br>He took a deep draught of his ale, still with his eyes searching above the rim of the wooden noggin. There was only a centimetre left when he set it down again. A serving girl, moving through the tables and collecting empty plates, paused to look into the noggin. Seeing it virtually empty, she reached for it. But the wagoner stopped her, grasping her wrist with unnecessary force so that she gasped.<br><br>&#x2018;Leave it,&#x2019; he ordered. &#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t finished.&#x2019;<br><br>She snatched her wrist away from his grip and curled her lip at him.<br><br>&#x2018;Big man,&#x2019; she sneered. &#x2018;Finish off your last few drops of ale then.&#x2019;<br><br>She stalked away angrily, turning once to glare back at him. As she did, a frown came over her face. There was a cloaked and cowled figure standing directly behind the wagoner&#x2019;s chair. She hadn&#x2019;t seen him arrive. She had no idea how he had appeared where he did. One moment, there was nobody near the wagoner. Then the cloaked man appeared, seemingly having risen out of the earth. She shook her head. That was fanciful, she thought. Then she reconsidered, noting the mottled green and grey cloak the man wore. It was a Ranger&#x2019;s cloak, and folk said that Rangers could do all manner of unnatural things &#x2013; such as rising out of the earth.<br>&nbsp;The Ranger stood directly behind the wagoner&#x2019;s chair. So far, the ill-tempered wagoner had no idea that he was there.<br><br>The shadow of the cowl hid the newcomer&#x2019;s features. All that was visible was a steel-grey beard. Then he slipped back the cowl to reveal a grim face, with dark eyes and grey, roughly trimmed hair to match the beard.<br><br>At the same time, he drew a heavy saxe knife from beneath the cloak and tapped its flat side gently on the wagoner&#x2019;s shoulder, leaving it resting there so the wagoner could see it with his peripheral vision.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t turn around.&#x2019;<br><br>The wagoner stiffened, sitting bolt upright on his bench. Instinctively, he began to turn to view the man behind him. The saxe rapped on his shoulder, harder this time.<br>&#x2018;I said don&#x2019;t.&#x2019;<br><br>The command was uttered in a more peremptory tone, and some of those nearby became aware of the scene playing out at the table. The low murmur of voices died away to silence as more people noticed. All eyes turned towards the rear table, where the wagoner sat, seemingly transfixed.<br>Somewhere, someone recognised the significance of the grey mottled cloak and the heavy saxe knife.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a Ranger.&#x2019;<br><br>The wagoner slumped as he heard the words, and a haunted look came over his face.<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re Henry Wheeler,&#x2019; the Ranger said.<br><br>Now the haunted look changed to one of abject fear. The big man shook his head rapidly, spittle flying from his lips as he denied the name.<br><br>&#x2018;No! I&#x2019;m Henry Carrier! You&#x2019;ve got the wrong man! I swear.&#x2019;<br><br>The Ranger&#x2019;s lips twisted in what might have been a smile. &#x2018;Wheeler ... Carrier. Not a very imaginative stretch if you&#x2019;re planning to change your name. And you should have got rid of the Henry.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about!&#x2019; the wagoner babbled. He began to turn to face his accuser. Again, the saxe rapped him sharply on the shoulder.<br><br>&#x2018;I told you. Don&#x2019;t turn around.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What do you want from me?&#x2019; The wagoner&#x2019;s voice was rising in pitch. Those watching were convinced that he knew why the grim-faced Ranger had singled him out.<br><br>&#x2018;Perhaps you could tell me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t done anything! Whoever this Carrier person is, it&#x2019;s not me! I tell you, you&#x2019;ve got the wrong man! Leave me be, I say.&#x2019;<br><br>He tried to put a sense of command into the last few words and failed miserably. They came out more as a guilt-laden plea for mercy than the indignation of an innocent man. The Ranger said nothing for a few seconds. Then he said three words.<br><br>&#x2018;The Wyvern Inn.&#x2019;<br><br>Now the guilt and fear were all too evident on the wagoner&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x2018;Remember it, Henry? The Wyvern Inn in Anselm Fief. Eighteen months ago. You were there.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No!<br><br>&#x2018;What about the name Jory Ruhl, Henry? Remember him? He was the leader of your gang, wasn&#x2019;t he?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I never heard of no Jory Ruhl!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, I think you have.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I never have! I was never at any Wyvern Inn and I had nothing to do with the ...&#x2019;<br><br>The big man stopped, realising he was convicting himself with his words.<br><br>&#x2018;So you weren&#x2019;t there, and you had nothing to do with ... what exactly, Henry?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Nothing! I never did nothing. You&#x2019;re twisting my words! I wasn&#x2019;t there! I don&#x2019;t know anything about what happened!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Are you referring to the blaze that you and Ruhl set in that inn, by any chance? There was a woman killed in that fire, remember? A Courier. She got out of the building. But there was a child trapped inside. Nobody important, just a peasant girl &#x2013; the sort of person you would consider beneath your notice.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No! You&#x2019;re making this up!&#x2019; Carrier cried.<br><br>But the Ranger was unrelenting. &#x2018;But the Courier didn&#x2019;t think she was unimportant, did she? She went back into the burning building to save her. She shoved the girl out through an upper floor window, then the roof collapsed and she was killed. Surely you remember now?&#x2019;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know any Wyvern Inn! I&#x2019;ve never been in Anselm Fief. You&#x2019;ve got the wrong &#x2013;&#x2019;<br><br>Suddenly, with a speed that belied his bulk, the wagoner was on his feet and whirling to his right to face the Ranger. As he began the movement, his right hand snatched the dagger from his belt and he swung it in a backhanded strike.<br><br>But, fast as he was, the Ranger was even faster. As the desperation had been mounting in Carrier&#x2019;s voice, he had been expecting some sudden, defiant movement like this. He took a swift half step backwards and the saxe came up to block the wagoner&#x2019;s dagger. The blades rang together with a rasping clang, then the Ranger countered the wagoner&#x2019;s move with his own. Pivoting on his right heel, he deflected the dagger even further with his saxe and followed the movement with an open-palmed strike with his left hand, hitting Carrier on the ridge of his jawline.<br><br>The wagoner grunted in shock and staggered back. Then his feet tangled in the bench he&#x2019;d been sitting on and he stumbled. He tried to catch his balance but instead crashed against the edge of the table, which caused him to overbalance and fall with a thud to the ground.<br><br>Those watching the struggle unfold looked puzzled as the wagoner lay there, unmoving. An ominous dark stain began to spread across the turf.<br><br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x2019; The steward moved from behind the serving table, with his two assistants in tow. He looked at the Ranger, who met his gaze steadily. Then the Ranger shrugged, gesturing towards the still figure on the ground. The steward tore his gaze away, knelt and reached to turn the heavy figure over.<br><br>The wagoner&#x2019;s eyes were wide open. The shock of what had happened was frozen on his face. His own dagger was buried deep in his chest.<br><br>&#x2018;He fell on his own knife. He&#x2019;s dead,&#x2019; the steward said. He looked up at the Ranger, but saw neither guilt nor regret in the dark eyes.<br><br>&#x2018;What a shame,&#x2019; said Will Treaty. Then, gathering his cloak around him, he turned and strode from the tent.</p><h2>Forbidden Journey: The Life of Alexandra David-Neel</h2><p>Recounts the life of the prolific author, inveterate explorer, pioneer feminist, and world authority on Tibetan Buddhist tantric rites</p><p>Explorer, feminist and an authority on Buddhist philosophy and Tibetan tantrism, Paris-born Louise Eugenie Alexandrine Marie David (18681969) was the author of 30 books on anthropology, geography, history, orientalism and philologyall, like her life, crammed with adventure. Nearing middle age and retired as an opera singer, she became the mistress and, subsequently, the wife of Philip Neel, a philandering French engineer in Tunis, whose financial support enabled her to spend her remaining life away from him. Eventually, disguised as a Tibetan beggar and having meanwhile adopted as her son a young Tibetan, she arrived at last in Lhasa in the winter of 1924, the first European woman to enter that forbidden city. Thereafter, until she died at the age of 101, she settled in southeastern France, in a villa named Fortress of Meditation, and received honors, awards, accolades from scholars, governments and institutions of learning. Despite its idiosyncratic manner and style, this romantic biography, relying extensively on David-Neel's letters and papers, adequately tells the story of an extraordinarily courageous woman.

Photos. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Born in 1858, Frenchwoman David-Neel went to London at 20 to study occultism, flirted with anarchism, and sang with an opera company that toured Indochina. At age 40 she began to write and lecture on Buddhism. At 55 she entered Tibet from China, traversed the mountains on foot, and became the first European woman to enter the holy city of Lhasa. The manuscripts that she brought out and translated preserve much of the culture that would otherwise be lost. This first biography in English is based on interviews, on David-Neel's books and letters, and on dossiers kept by governments that thought she was a spy. It takes care to explain the religious and cultural backgrounds and should appeal to general readers as well as scholars.

The place: the Balkan peninsula. Here in Ismail Kadare's novel, <i>The Three-Arched Bridge</i>, an Albanian monk chronicles the events surrounding the construction of a bridge across a great river known as Ujana e Keqe, or "Wicked Waters." If successful in their endeavor, the bridge-builders will challenge a monopoly on water transportation known simply as "Boats and Rafts." The story itself parallels developments in modern-day Eastern Europe, with the bridge emblematic of a disintegrating economic and political order: just as mysterious cracks in the span's masonry endanger the structure and cast the local community into a morass of uncertainty, superstition, and murder, so the fast-changing conditions in the 14th-century Balkan peninsula threaten to overwhelm the stability of life there. <p> Dark as the story itself is, Mr. Kadare's prose, skillfully translated from the Albanian by John Hodgson, is elegant, witty, and deft. And with so many twists and turns in its carefully constructed plot, this political parable keeps the reader's interest to the very end.</p>Balkan peninsula is a bridge between cultures. On one side lies the flotsam of the receding Byzantine empire, an unruly alliance whose peoples quarrel in half a dozen tongues; on the other, the encroaching hordes of Ottoman Turkey. On the banks of a river somewhere in between these powers, another bridge is rising. And in telling its story, Albania's greatest living writer creates what is at once a magnificently realized historical novel and a chilling parable of the new barbarism that has swept the Balkans.<br><br>When mysterious acts of sabotage halt construction of the three-arched bridge, a man suspected of the crimes is discovered walled up in the foundation, with only his head protruding from the stone. Is his death meant to deter other saboteurs or to appease the spirits of the river? Does it fulfill an ancient prophecy or predict further bloodshed? Superbly written, resonant with menace and sorrow, <i>The Three-Arched Bridge</i> is as powerful an evocation of a vanished world as &amp;</p><h2>The Fever</h2><p>Kept awake by illness, a traveler considers the contradiction of his life of privilege and the suffering found in the country he is visiting</p><p>Wallace Shawn's first play to be produced in New York was Our Late Night, directed by Andre Gregory at The Public Theater in 1975. A Thought in Three Parts was staged two years later by the Joint Stock Theatre Group in London, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. Shawn's next three plays - Marie and Bruce, Aunt Dan &amp; Lemon, and The Fever - were all performed in New York at the Public Theater and in London at the Royal Court. Aunt Dan and Lemon was revived in London in 1999 at the Almeida Theatre, directed by Tom Cairns. Shawn's next play, The Designated Mourner, premiered at the National Theatre, London, with Mike Nichols, Miranda Richardson, and David de Keyser under the direction of David Hare, and was then performed in New York by Wallace Shawn, Deborah Eisenberg, and Larry Pine under the direction of Andre Gregory. In 2009, the Royal Court held a Wallace Shawn season, reviving Aunt Dan and Lemon and The Fever, and staging the premiere of Grasses of a Thousand Colours. Shawn wrote the libretto for Allen Shawn's opera The Music Teacher, directed by Tom Cairns for The New Group in New York (2006). Shawn translated Brecht's The Threepenny Opera (performed in New York at the Roundabout, Studio 54, directed by Scott Elliott). Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory wrote and performed in the film My Dinner with Andre and Andre Gregory directed Shawn in Vanya on 42nd Street. Shawn has appeared as an actor in many films, including Manhattan, Clueless, Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,The Moderns, and The Wife. Shawn's Essays was published by Haymarket Books in 2009.The narrator is having a mid-life crisis. He's shaking and vomiting in a hotel in a strange Third World country, contemplating the plight of the poor and the oppressed around the globe. As his annoying interior monologue unfolds, he becomes increasingly nauseated by the ignorance and complacency of his own moneyed existence, although he's not quite ready to give up the perks of privilege--luxury hotels, fine restaurants, glamorous theater events--in order that others might be able to feed their hungry children. The speaker wonders how he and his friends could be "decorating their lives and their world as if they were having a permanent party" while citizens in countries under totalitarian rule are being tortured and killed, yet he is unable to shake the contempt he feels for the impoverished. At the end of this pointless book, Shawn states that the considerable efforts of concerned parents, artists and politicians "do not change the life of the poor," a conclusion that the narrator conveniently employs to alleviate his guilt long enough to allow him a decent night's rest. This work was the basis for a dramatic monologue performed in New York City. Shawn is a playwright and actor. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>M�R, Vol. 7 (7)</h2><p>A junior high loser enters the vivid world of his dreams where, at last, he is a hero!<br><br>Ginta Toramizu is a 14-year-old kid in junior high school who doesn't have a lot going for him: he's near-sighted, doesn't do well in school, he's not good at sports, and to top it off-he's short!

Some volunteered, but most were given no choice, in particular about whether to become a sniper or to fill some other combat role.<br><br>After a few months of brutal training, the female snipers were issued with high-powered rifles and sent to the front. Almost without exception, their first kill came as a great shock, and changed them forever. But as the number of kills grew, many snipers became addicted to their new profession, some to the point of becoming depressed if a "hunt" proved fruitless.<br><br>Accounts from the veterans of the female sniper corps include vivid descriptions of the close bonds they formed with their fellow soldiers, but also the many hardships and deprivations they faced: days and days in a trench without enough food, water, or rest, their lives constantly at risk from the enemy and from the cold; burying their friends, most of them yet to leave their teenage years; or the frequent sexual harassment by male officers.<br><br>Although many of these young women were killed, often on their first day of combat, the majority returned from the front, only to face the usual constellation of trials with which every war veteran is familiar. Some continued their studies, but most were forced to work, even as they also started families or struggled to adjust to life as single parents. Nearly all of them were still in their early twenties, and despite the physical and mental scars left by the war, they had no time for complaints as the Soviet Union rebuilt following the war.<br><br>Drawing on original interviews, diaries, and previously unpublished archival material, historian Lyuba Vinogradova has produced an unparalleled quilt of first-person narratives about these women's lives. This fascinating document brings the realities and hardships faced by the Red Army's female sniper corps to life, shedding light on a little-known aspect of the Soviet Union's struggles against Hitler's war machine.<br></p><p><b>Dr. Lyuba Vinogradova </b>was born in Moscow in 1973.

In 2012, ninety percent or more of adoption agencies are recommending open adoption. Yet these agencies do not often or adequately prepare either adopting parents or birth parents for the road ahead of them! The adult parties in open adoptions are left floundering.<br><br>There are many resources on why to do open adoption, but what about how? Open adoption isn't just something parents do when they exchange photos, send emails, share a visit. It's a lifestyle that may feel intrusive at times, be difficult or inconvenient at other times. Tensions can arise even in the best of circumstances. But knowing how to handle these situations and how to continue to make arrangements work for the child involved is paramount. This book offers readers the tools and the insight to do just that. It covers common open-adoption situations and how real families have navigated typical issues successfully. Like all useful parenting books, it provides parents with the tools to come to answers on their own, and answers questions that might not yet have come up.<br><br>Through their own stories and those of other families of open adoption, Lori and Crystal review the secrets to success, the pitfalls and challenges, the joys and triumphs. By putting the adopted child at the center, families can come to enjoy the benefits of open adoption and mitigate the challenges that may arise. <br><br>More than a how-to, this book shares a mindset, a heartset, that can be learned and internalized, so parents can choose to act out of love and honesty throughout their child&#x2019;s growing up years, helping that child to grow up whole.<br></p><p>Lori Holden was named a Top 10 &#x201c;Must-Read Mom&#x201d; by Parenting magazine and was honored at the annual BlogHer Conference.

She is a monthly contributor to MileHighMamas.com, a Denver Post site. In addition, Lori has written for The American Fertility Association, CreatingAFamily.org and Kaiser Permanente&#x2019;s Partners in Health magazine. With Crystal, her daughter&#x2019;s birth mom, she teaches classes on building a child-centered open adoption. <br>Crystal Hass has taught about open adoption with Lori Holden at Colorado Free University and at adoption agencies.Holden&#x2019;s debut is an insightful, heartfelt exploration of open adoption, an evolving arrangement that has been growing in popularity over the last 20 years. Her endorsement is personal; she has two children from open adoptions and maintains that openness helps heal adoption&#x2019;s split between a person&#x2019;s &#x201c;biology&#x201d; and &#x201c;biography&#x201d;. She references open adoption as a &#x201c;process&#x201d; that encourages high-functioning relationships between birth parents, extended family members, and adopted parents. Open, honest, age-appropriate dialogue with adopted children about their biological background is stressed. Part one addresses basic information about open adoption, including common terminology, benefits as well as challenges, ethical concerns, choosing a professional to help navigate the process, dealing with the grief of infertility prior to adoption, and ingredients for a successful open adoption. Advice on how to incorporate, and set boundaries with, birth parents and extended birth families are included. Part two emphasizes the child (adoptee), and helps children respond to insensitive questions from others. Foster, international, and donor situations are also detailed. Anecdotes from birth parents, adoptive parents, and adult adopted children are included, establishing rapport between readers and real-life families. Holden skillfully covers many bases, including potential &#x201c;bumps in the road,&#x201d; offering appendices and resources for further guidance. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Written with input from her daughter&#x2019;s birth mother Crystal Hass, The Open-Hearted Way to Open Adoption: Helping Your Child Grow Up Whole is both personal and dispassionate. A primer for open adoption, Holden's book is full of personal anecdotes from her own life as well as others living open adoption. Lori isn&#x2019;t an expert, a social worker, or a psychologist. She&#x2019;s a mom and super-connected blogger with two children on the brink of young adulthood, both of whom have sometimes on-again, off-again relationships with their birth parents. . . . The book offers practical tools to help adoptive parents make decisions about everything from embarking on an open adoption to opening a closed local or international adoption. She gives concrete how-to&#x2019;s on managing visits (use the in-law test), talking to the public about your adoption (educate, use humor, ask a question or say it&#x2019;s private), handling difficult subjects and feelings with your kids (depersonalize the situation), and coaching your kids on how to handle comments from peers (choose whether to share, walk away, educate or say &#x201c;it&#x2019;s private&#x201d;). . . . The meat of the book is devoted to families living open adoption, which is where the book really shines. There are helpful sections for pre-adoptive parents wondering how to enter an open adoption, families in difficult or challenging situations with birth parents (common in foster care adoptions, closed adoptions that could be opened and international adoptions on the brink of openness. (<i>Focus on Adoption</i>)<br><br>I would highly recommend reading this book if you are waiting to adopt or if you are in an open adoption and looking for more guidance or information. Holden walks the reader through adoption &#x2013; from the beginning stages, to the new relationship stage between the child, the birth parents, and the adoptive parents, to a relationship that will grow as time moves on. Holden and Hass share their views on what makes their adoption work and also share the views of others involved in their own open adoptions. The Open-Hearted Way to Open Adoption is a great book and should be used as a tool that can offer advice, anecdotes, and knowledge to anyone navigating their way through an open adoption relationship.

The locale for this fantasy by SF writer Cherryh ( Downbelow Station ) is pre-Christian Russia. Two young men flee the village of Vojvoda--Pyetr, accused of killing a wealthy noble, and Sasha, an accessory to his escape. They are making their way to Kiev when, in the middle of a forest, they become involved in the search for the wizard Uulamets's dead daughter Eveshka, a Rusalka and a wizard herself. Uulamets wants to resurrect her, but evil forces oppose him, among whom may be Kavi Chernevog, Uulamets's former student, and a suspect in Eveshka's death.

With incomparable glee, Miller shifts effortlessly from Virgil to venereal disease, from Rabelais to Roquefort. In this seductive technicolor swirl of Paris and New York, he captures like no one else the blending of people and the cities they inhabit.</p><p>Henry Miller (1891-1980) was an American writer whose novels were notable for their breaking with literary conventions, and also for their frankness about sex, with the result that many of his works were banned in the U.S. on the grounds of obscenity.</p><h2>Dictionary of Archaic Words</h2><p>This book is a facsimile edition of a work first published in 1880.

The year 1989 was one such crucial watershed. This book uses previously unavailable sources to explore the momentous events following the fall of the Berlin Wall twenty years ago and the effects they have had on our world ever since.</p><p> Based on documents, interviews, and television broadcasts from many different locations, including Moscow, Berlin, Bonn, Paris, London, and Washington, 1989 describes how Germany unified, NATO expansion began, and Russia got left on the periphery of the new Europe. Mary Sarotte explains that while it was clear past a certain point that the Soviet Bloc would crumble, there was nothing inevitable about what would follow. A wide array of political players--from leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev, Helmut Kohl, George H. W. Bush, and James Baker, to organizations like NATO and the European Community, to courageous individual dissidents--all proposed courses of action and models for the future. In front of global television cameras, a competition ensued, ultimately won by those who wanted to ensure that the "new" order looked very much like the old. Sarotte explores how the aftermath of this fateful victory, and Russian resentment of it, continue to shape world politics today.</p><p> Presenting diverse perspectives from the political elite as well as ordinary citizens, 1989 is compelling reading for anyone who cares about international relations past, present, or future.</p></p><p><p>"Mary Sarotte's <i>1989</i> reinterprets, in a striking manner, the end of the Cold War in Europe. Based on extensive multiarchival research, it suggests a Bismarckian preeminence for West German chancellor Helmut Kohl in driving the course of events. All students of this subject will henceforth have to grapple with this provocatively persuasive argument."<b>--John Lewis Gaddis, Yale University, author of<i>The Cold War</i></b></p><p>"Sarotte makes an essential contribution to the literature on the revolutions of 1989.

Based on new archival material and extensive interviews with participants in these events, she argues convincingly that the United States and its partners missed a one-time opportunity to devise a post-Cold War architecture that would have made Europe more secure."<b>--Angela Stent, Georgetown University, author of <i>Russia and Germany Reborn</i></b></p><p>"Sarotte has written a major book about one of the most important events at the end of the Cold War--the international negotiations which culminated in the unification of Germany.

We are introduced to the rural Mexico, full of mystery and turbulence, that shapes the enormously imaginative young Rivera's worldview--and a place that would remain his most enduring creative influence. We see the young apprentice leave Mexico for Spain on a government grant and then go on to Italy, where he first encounters the work of the great fresco painters that will change his life and art forever; to Paris, where he settles in Montparnasse at the epicenter of the legendary artistic circle living there at the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;including Picasso (both his great friend and his rival), Modigliani, Matisse, L�ger and Braque. We see Rivera travel to Moscow to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, and begin his lifelong flirtation with Communism. And by 1930, with his young wife, Frida Kahlo, Rivera finally makes his way to North America, where he is to work on three major mural projects--one of which, commissioned by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller for the new Rockefeller Center, will end in disaster and furious international controversy for the artist, and force his return to Mexico. <br><br>Throughout we are witness to Rivera's immense passions--his countless lovers, his stormy relationship with Frida Kahlo, his political bravado, his massive strength and maniacal work ethic--which fueled his highest artistic achievements and made for an extraordinarily complex life. Marnham conveys to us the impact of this galvanic force that was Rivera's creative drive and personality, and shows why he was perhaps the greatest muralist since the Renaissance.</p><p>What confidence and ambition it requires to approach a biography of Diego Rivera, the larger-than-life Mexican muralist who in recent years has been reduced, in some circles, to being known as Frida Kahlo's evil husband. The myths and mysteries begin at his birth, in 1884. His mother seemed to die just after Diego, a firstborn twin, emerged, and her body was laid out for burial, until an old servant insisted she was still breathing. She recovered fully (Diego's twin died at age 2). This macabre event was but the first in a fabulously eventful life. <p> Under the brutal regime of the dictator Porfirio D�az, whose legacy included human slavery on an unprecedented scale, Mexico City became "The Paris of the Americas," with imperial palaces, European music, and decorations by artists who had studied under Ingres. "It was in this exuberant, chaotic, and occasionally dangerous world that Diego Rivera grew up," writes Patrick Marnham, who casts a spell of such strangeness, beauty, and black humor that the reader is utterly hooked by the end of the first few pages. Marnham repeats and analyses all the fables Rivera spun about himself and his family; he describes Rivera's enchantment with Italian fresco cycles and his friendship and rivalry with Picasso in Montmartre in the 1920s; he reports Rivera's countless amorous conquests; and he presents the supposedly feminist view of Rivera as a monster of appetite, arrogance, and authority. Marnham also does an excellent job of picking apart the personal, political, and artistic threads of the disastrous brouhaha over Rivera's Rockefeller Center murals. In prose that is poetically rich and frequently tinged with not-so-gentle irony, he has written a thoroughly believable book about an all but unbelievable life. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Patrick Marnham is the author of several books, including Fantastic Invasion: Dispatches from Africa;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man Who Wasn't Maigret: A Portrait of Georges Simenon, which won the Marsh Biography Award and was nominated for a 1994 Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America; and So Far from God: A Journey to Central America, which was awarded the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award.

Sure, being bitten by a radioactive spider had to hurt like hell initially, but you have to admit the resulting upside was pretty sweet: the ability to climb walls, sense incoming danger, shoot webs from his wrists, and catapult himself across rooftops during rush hour&#x2014;what&#x2019;s not to love about that? For most of us, our teenage years were a prolonged, stumbling, hormone-addled mess, so a brief moment of subatomic agony would have been well worth the benefits it afforded in expediency alone. If you&#x2019;re going to go through the dizzying arrival of puberty anyway, at least the transformation could be quick, dramatic, and awe-inspiring. Peter was one of the lucky ones. His metamorphosis happened in one brilliant, cataclysmic instant&#x2014;instead of over a few brutal years of awkwardness, heartbreak, and bad skin. Unlike most of us, he received the payoff in a matter of breathtaking seconds. He didn&#x2019;t have to wait to become amazing or hope he&#x2019;d one day be super. Meanwhile, if you&#x2019;re anything like me, you probably feel like you&#x2019;re still patiently waiting and hoping for heroic things to happen in you.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why we all love to see superheroes being born in pages or on-screen. There&#x2019;s something magical about those beginnings that moves us. Whether they&#x2019;re bitten by a radioactive spider, injected with a secret government superserum, implanted with a steel skeleton, or overexposed to hulkifying gamma rays, every great hero has an amazing origin story, a precise moment when he or she is called upon by circumstance, fate, or providence to do something extraordinary, something meaningful, something altogether history-shifting. It&#x2019;s thrilling to watch human beings mutating from nondescript, regular schlubs like you and me into the monumental stuff of legend, to see them struggle to comprehend the gravity of the moment, to recognize the responsibility of access to such great power&#x2014;and ultimately to run, swing, or fly headlong into their destiny. Over and over again we line up to breathe in these mythologies, because we love the idea of being thrust into stratospheric glory instead of being stuck here on the ground with the rest of the mere mortals and gawking bystanders. We inhabit daily lives that tend to feel decidedly nonsuper, a repetitive cycle of mundane tasks and soul-draining busywork made of laundry loads, traffic jams, and dental appointments, and as we get older it becomes a lot easier to hope vicariously through someone else&#x2019;s story than our own. We gradually lose our ability to dream.<br> <br>Children don&#x2019;t usually struggle with such effortless imagination and boundless optimism. My eight-year-old daughter, Selah, certainly doesn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d call her primary superpower explosiveness. She ricochets through this life full speed and wide open, bouncing through her days fueled by a combustible cocktail of joy, confidence, expectancy, and Skittles. She fully believes that she&#x2019;s unstoppable, and she&#x2019;s not alone. Most children are peerless superheroes&#x2014;just ask them. Sit down with a group of second graders and wonder out loud, &#x201c;Who here is a dancer?&#x201d; and every hand will go up. Ask, &#x201c;Are there any artists in the room?&#x201d; Each will volunteer with unabashed enthusiasm. Interrogate them further: &#x201c;How many of you are supersmart?&#x201d; To a child, they will gladly cop to their brilliance without a trace of arrogance, seemingly fully aware of their infinite capacity to do beautiful things and blissfully ignorant of any weaknesses. Ask the same question of a group of teenagers or adults, and you will get a decidedly different response: an array of caveats and qualifiers and self-critical comments. You&#x2019;ll see people avoiding eye contact and internally disqualifying themselves. That&#x2019;s because over time, we experience enough failure and rejection, we hear enough about our flaws and deficiencies, until we finally concede that this is our true identity, that whatever we are now is the best we can hope for. We begin to hear in our heads the voices of our critics and adversaries, of deceased parents, ex-spouses, and former bosses, and we ratify the gaslighter&#x2019;s lie that we are far less than spectacular. This is why embracing your inherent and abiding superness isn&#x2019;t about figuring out how to become anything but about realizing what you&#x2019;ve forgotten about yourself since you were young, the truth you&#x2019;ve lost along the way about who you are, what you&#x2019;re made of, and your capacity to be great. Like my daughter, you, too, were designed to live wide open and to dance and sing and dream wildly. You simply need to remember the ass-kicking glory you were made for and to prepare yourself for the ever-present opportunities you have to still be super.<br> <br>Every hero is pulled into significance differently. Batman rises from the ashes of his parents&#x2019; murder to defend a crime-riddled Gotham. Wonder Woman feels compelled to come to the aid of outnumbered Allied soldiers facing the Third Reich, after being cared for by one of them. Black Panther fully claims his birthright as king after realizing his nation&#x2019;s former missteps. Spider-Man is transformed after recognizing the great responsibility accompanying his great power. Black Widow is moved to make amends for her deadly assassin&#x2019;s past. They all become undeniably heroic, yet in ways and circumstances that look nothing alike and with completely unique motivations. In the same way, you and I will each receive a one of a kind, time-sensitive invitation to step into a better version of ourselves: a personal tragedy, a national crisis, a cause that moves us, or a desire to use a gift for the good of others. This is the beauty of our origin stories: they are completely personalized. They are unprecedented occasions. We become specifically heroic as we move to answer a call that we alone can answer&#x2014;because we are the only ones able to hear it.<br> <br>On November 9, 2016, one of my calls came quite literally overnight. I&#x2019;d spent the early morning hours following the presidential election fielding messages that began pouring in from all sorts of people in acute crisis, men and women seeing what felt like their most terrifying nightmares springing to life. As quickly as I could reply to one, dozens more came in. The scale and velocity of the pain were overwhelming&#x2014;and continue to be. Later that morning, while it was still dark, without having slept more than a few scattered moments, I sat down and composed a blog post called &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s Why We Grieve Today,&#x201d; hoping to synthesize the heaviness people had been sharing with me, the sense of loss and missed opportunity so many were feeling and trying to process. By the end of the day, two and a half million people had read the post&#x2014;and by Friday of that week nearly four million. I began to realize that this was an opportunity to help people from a distance. I could walk with them as they grieved by giving voice to their confusion, fear, and anguish. I could put words to people&#x2019;s pain, I could loudly advocate for those who were being marginalized, and I could openly resist a corrupt power that was gaining traction. Even in the sadness that I and so many others felt in those hours, I found solace in realizing that my years as a pastor and activist and writer and social media presence had all left me uniquely positioned and prepared to help people in that precise moment. My platform and my words could be weapons used to push back against the terrors&#x2014;and I was grateful to be drafted into battle.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t alone in the fight either. After the 2016 election, millions of Americans responded to what was their worst-case scenario by allowing it to catalyze them into a level of activism and engagement they&#x2019;d never imagined themselves capable of. A generation of ordinary superheroes was born, as people used whatever they had at their disposal to defend the country they loved and the issues that burdened them. But we see similar opportunities for metamorphosis much closer to home&#x2014;the loss of loved ones or career changes or unexpected illness or needs in our community. Adversity (ours or others&#x2019;) is always an invitation to be transformed, and like it or not we can find plenty of that the longer we&#x2019;re here. The suffering we see in the world, the divisions in our nation, the disappointments we accrue, and the struggles of parenting, marriage, and career are all potential places where either our defeat can be finalized&#x2014;or our destiny clarified. They can be sources of growing bitterness or spaces for cultivating hope. The difference between the two is often a matter of the lenses we view these moments with, and the small choices we make in a million seemingly unremarkable moments.<br> <br>Though we&#x2019;d probably prefer it, we rarely discover the heroic mettle within us until we reach what we believe to be the limits of our ability and tolerance for pain. And that is one of the difficult ironies of this life: tragedy is an opportunity to become something we couldn&#x2019;t become in any other way. The Christian tradition calls this &#x201c;rejoicing in trials&#x201d;: the awareness in the moment that present difficulty is infinitely valuable and uniquely formative. In layman&#x2019;s terms, it just means to be glad when you&#x2019;re getting the shit kicked out of you because that shit-kicking is rebuilding you in beautiful ways despite the bruises and gashes you sustain. Whenever Fantastic Four team member (and talking pile of orange rocks) the Thing has endured enough pummeling from his adversaries and is ready to turn the tables, he shouts his famous rallying cry: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clobberin&#x2019; time!&#x201d; and proceeds to lay waste to the bad guys. Yet that victorious, redemptive moment never comes until he has been sufficiently throttled himself.<br> <br>For me, life came clobberin&#x2019; four years ago, when my father died very suddenly while on a vacation cruise. When I got the call from my younger brother with the news of his passing, I dropped to the ground in front of our house and felt the world cave in around me. As my tears fell onto the grass beneath me, I was as helpless and broken as I&#x2019;d ever been, a full-blown Armageddon exploding inside my head. Later that week, I sat across from my dear friend Brenda in a crowded coffee shop. Encouragement is Brenda&#x2019;s greatest superpower, among many. Through the thick haze of my grief, I remember her looking into my tear-blurred, bloodshot eyes and saying, &#x201c;John, this is going to give you a layer of compassion that you&#x2019;ve never had. You&#x2019;ll understand people&#x2019;s pain in a deeper way than ever before, and you&#x2019;ll be able to help them.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t much consolation then, but she was right, because that&#x2019;s how grief and sorrow and all varieties of emotional catastrophe work: you never really get it until you&#x2019;re grieving or hurting or struggling. There&#x2019;s no way to comprehend real loss other than to walk through it&#x2014;and once you have, you want to walk with others because you understand how terribly exhausting it is to endure alone.<br> <br>Just a few days after losing my father I started writing about my grief on my blog. I did it primarily to try to retain my sanity, but soon realized that it was encouraging other people who were also in the thick blackness of what I began to refer to as the Grief Valley. Their solidarity from a distance, in turn, helped lift me through those days, and it gave me some measure of solace to know that something productive was coming out of my profound pain. I ended up documenting that first year on the blog and have continued recording the things I&#x2019;ve learned along the way about the attrition of loss. I&#x2019;ve since led retreats on grief, counseled hundreds of people, and reached millions of others through writing&#x2014;all by doing nothing more than telling my story and showing my scars.<br> <br>Brenda knew what she was talking about. She knew the productive nature of suffering and that time and distance would help me&#x2014;as it will surely help you&#x2014;figure out how to channel defeats and deaths into something life-affirming. And that&#x2019;s a key lesson to embrace as you try to be the kind of person the world needs, the kind who can save the world; the adversity you&#x2019;ve endured and the battles you&#x2019;ve weathered, as terrible as they are in real time, are necessary to call you to a deeper place of compassion and kindness than you would otherwise be capable of.<br> <br>Ironically, similar moments of total desperation are an absolute blast to read in a book or see on the big screen. We love it when our caped crusaders are pushed to the very brink of obliteration, to the very last thread of their final rope, because that makes their coming victory all the more thrilling. We see all that they&#x2019;ve endured, and it makes us root for them even harder, and the celebration in the closing minutes becomes all the more jubilant. But in real life, we never see these times as climactic narrative pivot points or necessary character-defining moments set to music. We rarely find ourselves in the middle of everything hitting the fan and think, &#x201c;This is going to make an awesome story! This is going to help people one day!&#x201d; We almost never experience pain and imagine what it is producing in us other than discomfort, and we certainly don&#x2019;t welcome it like a dear friend arriving on our doorstep, or see it as an incubator for our best selves.<br> <br>And that may be the initial switch that needs to take place in us as we embrace our superhumanness during days that feel oppressively heavy. Maybe we need to take some time to purposefully rewind and chart the past moments of our lives&#x2014;recording every crushing defeat, every failed venture, every aha moment, every broken relationship, every wonderful surprise&#x2014;and to take stock of how these experiences have uniquely prepared and strengthened us. Not only that, but we can see in the rearview mirror how we&#x2019;ve cultivated values and honed skills and acquired resources in the process. We can be encouraged that yes, we are qualified, because we&#x2019;ve paid our dues over time and in tears and through trials. My friend Ed calls this a crossroads map, the retrospective look at all we&#x2019;ve endured so that we can spot and acknowledge what it&#x2019;s done within us. If we can see the redemptive value of all the horrible things we&#x2019;ve walked through to this second, maybe it can help us the next time we face a trial or feel forsaken. Rather than simply going through something painful or witnessing tragedy and falling apart, we can pause to consider how it might be shaping us. We can be aware that we are being forged in the fire of present struggle. We can begin transforming our disappointments and frustrations into calling even as we grieve them. It means we can see others&#x2019; burdens and move to alleviate them. It means we can unapologetically give voice to concealed dreams we&#x2019;ve been carrying around in silence. It means we can walk boldly into the day believing we have something to give the world that it needs and that no one else is capable of giving. It means we can be heroic in more than just our daydreams but in our real nightmares, too.<br> <br>When I was a kid in a suburban small town in central New York, my father owned a shoe store, which was sandwiched between a dry cleaner and a dance studio. The pungent smell of the pant presses from the former and the staccato rhythms on the hardwood floor from the latter are both deeply embedded in me as sense memories.

Rodriguez and the Pursuit of Equal Education: The Debate over Discrimination and School Funding (Landmark Law Cases &amp; American Society)</h2><p>When Arthur Gochman filed a class-action suit in 1968 on behalf of San Antonio school children, he and his clients were directly challenging the inequality of education funding in Texas. They argued that quality education, not merely basic schooling, was a constitutional right, and a district court agreed. But the Supreme Court overruled that decision, signaling a halt to the idea that the Constitution contained a right to an equal education and marking an important transition from the Warren to the Burger Court. <br><br>Paul Sracic assesses the impact of this 5-4 decision to explore the legacy of a landmark case, telling the story of the Supreme Court and school finance in a new way. His is the first book to consider <i>Rodriguez</i>, tracing its progress from inception through appeal to provide a fascinating account of the legal maneuvering of the two sides-and a lesson in the limits of judicial solutions to discrimination in education. <br><br>Balanced and judicious in his assessment, Sracic brings together the varied strands-oral history, litigation, constitutional law, political context-in this complex case, while clarifying the positions on both sides of the conflict. Justice Lewis Powell argued that education was not a constitutionally protected right and that the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages, while dissenting Justice Thurgood Marshall called the decision a retreat from America's commitment to equal opportunity that denigrated <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>. <br><br>Although Powell's and Marshall's opinions have been documented, until now little has been written about the history behind the case. Sracic puts a human face on the account. Among other things, he interviewed Demetrio Rodriguez, the parent whose name headlined the original suit, along with several students involved in the case. He also delved into Justice Powell's papers to show the influence of his prior experience championing local rather than state control over education and his fear of centralization's potential constraint on states' rights. <br><br>In the wake of <i>Rodriguez</i>, the issue of school funding acquired a much higher national profile, even as efforts to reform it struggled towards varied degrees of success&#x2014;in Texas and many other states. Sracic's very readable account unravels the complex legal doctrine links this vitally important case to the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection&#x2014;and argues that one cannot fully grasp the scope of that amendment without fully understanding <i>Rodriguez</i>.</p><p>"I was a participant in this litigation, coauthoring a number of briefs, and I have been involved in school finance issues for more than 30 years. In my judgment this is the best work I have ever read on the foundational <i>Rodriguez case</i>. . . . The interwoven stories of the participants are fascinating and the text is engaging, lucid, and accurate, and certainly accessible to the general reader. But scholars will not find the work lacking. Sracic has done his homework, and it shows on every page."--Mark Yudof, Chancellor of the University of Texas System and coauthor of <i>Education Policy and the Law</i>Paul A.

Murray&#39;s two volume record of the life of David Martyn Lloyd-Jones is one of the great Christian biographies of the twentieth century. It tells the remarkable story of an outstanding young physician&#39;s call to the Christian ministry and the widespread lasting influence of his preaching and spiritual leadership, first in his native Wales and thereafter in London and throughout the world. But a man&#39;s letters tell the story of his pilgrimage from within, and here, in over one hundred of his personal letters, we encounter Martyn Lloyd-Jones first hand. Although he thought of himself as a &#39;poor correspondent&#39;, these pages tell a different story, unselfconsciously displaying the tender forcefulness of a personality which left an indelible impression on those who knew him personally. Here we catch a glimpse of the rounded and balanced picture of the man: the physician and the preacher, the student of deep theology who was fascinated by agricultural life; the lover of books who cared about people; the ardent Welshman who devoted his years to Christian service in England and beyond. In this attractive and fascinating volume, Iain M divides the correspondence in a way which gives insight into the different areas of Lloyd-Jones&#39; life (family, church, colleagues in the Christian service) but at the same time retains chronological sequence and development. Perfectly complementing the biography, The Letters of D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones reveals the heartbeat of his life : &#39;Not what we have been, not what we have done, but the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>The Number Of The Beast --2007 publication.</h2><p>Dr. Zebadiah John Carter, Dr. Dejah Thoris Burroughs (Deety to her friends), Deety&#39;s brainiac father, Jake, and her &#34;Aunt&#34; Hilda are running off to Reno for a quickie double wedding when a car bomb narrowly misses killing them all.

If our technological society collapsed tomorrow, perhaps from a viral pandemic or catastrophic asteroid impact, what would be the one book you would want to press into the hands of the postapocalyptic survivors? What crucial knowledge would they need to survive in the immediate aftermath and to rebuild civilization as quickly as possible-a guide for rebooting the world? Human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. It has built on itself for centuries, becoming vast and increasingly specialized. Most of us are ignorant about the fundamental principles of the civilization that supports us, happily utilizing the latest-or even the most basic-technology without having the slightest idea of why it works or how it came to be. If you had to go back to absolute basics, like some sort of postcataclysmic Robinson Crusoe, would you know how to re-create an internal combustion engine, put together a microscope, get metals out of rock, accurately tell time, weave fibers into clothing, or even how to produce food for yourself? Regarded as one of the brightest young scientists of his generation, Lewis Dartnell proposes that the key to preserving civilization in an apocalyptic scenario is to provide a quickstart guide, adapted to cataclysmic circumstances. The Knowledge describes many of the modern technologies we employ, but first it explains the fundamentals upon which they are built. Every piece of technology rests on an enormous support network of other technologies, all interlinked and mutually dependent. You can&#39;t hope to build a radio, for example, without understanding how to acquire the raw materials it requires, as well as generate the electricity needed to run it. But Dartnell doesn&#39;t just provide specific information for starting over; he also reveals the greatest invention of them all-the phenomenal knowledge-generating machine that is the scientific method itself. This would allow survivors to learn technological advances not explicitly explored in The Knowledge as well as things we have yet to discover. The Knowledge is a brilliantly original guide to the fundamentals of science and how it built our modern world as well as a thought experiment about the very idea of scientific knowledge itself.</p><p>Lewis Dartnell is a UK Space Agency research fellow at the University of Leicester, working in the field of astrobiology and the search for microbial life on Mars. The author of Life in the Universe and My Tourist Guide to the Solar System, he has won several awards for his science writing and outreach work.<p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT HAS ENDED.</p><p>A particularly virulent strain of avian flu finally breached the species barrier and hopped successfully to human hosts, or was deliberately released in an act of bioterrorism. The contagion spread devastatingly quickly in the modern age of high-density cities and intercontinental air travel, and killed a large proportion of the global population before any effective immunization or even quarantine orders could be implemented.</p><p>Or tensions between India and Pakistan reached the breaking point and a border dispute escalated beyond all rational limits, culminating in the use of nuclear weapons. The warheads&#x2019; distinctive electromagnetic pulses were detected by defense surveillance in China and triggered a round of preemptive launches against the United States, which in turn spurred retaliatory strikes by America and its allies in Europe and Israel. Major cities worldwide were reduced to jagged plains of radioactive glass. The enormous volumes of dust and ash injected into the atmosphere reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, causing a decades-long nuclear winter, the collapse of agriculture, and global famine.</p><p>Or the event was entirely beyond human control. A rocky asteroid, only around a mile across, slammed into the Earth and fatally changed atmospheric conditions. People within a few hundred kilometers of ground zero were dispatched in an instant by the blast wave of intense heat and pressure, and from that point on most of the rest of humanity was living on borrowed time. It didn&#x2019;t really matter which nation was struck: the rock and dust hurled up high into the atmosphere&#x2014;as well as the smoke produced by widespread fires ignited by the heat blast&#x2014;dispersed on the winds to smother the entire planet. As in a nuclear winter, global temperatures dropped enough to cause worldwide crop failures and massive famine.</p><p>This is the stuff of so many novels and films featuring post-apocalyptic worlds. The immediate aftermath is often&#x2014;as in <i>Mad Max</i> or Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s novel <i>The Road</i>&#x2014;portrayed as barren and violent. Roving bands of scavengers hoard the remaining food and prey ruthlessly on those less well organized or armed. I suspect that, at least for a period after the initial shock of collapse, this might not be too far from the truth. I&#x2019;m an optimist, though: I think morality and rationality would ultimately prevail, and settlement and rebuilding begin.</p><p>The world as we know it has ended. The crucial question is: now what?</p><p>Once the survivors have come to terms with their predicament&#x2014;the collapse of the entire infrastructure that previously supported their lives&#x2014;what can they do to rise from the ashes to ensure they thrive in the long term? What crucial knowledge would they need to recover as rapidly as possible?</p><p>This is a survivors&#x2019; guidebook. Not one just concerned with keeping people alive in the weeks after the Fall&#x2014;plenty of handbooks have been written on survival skills&#x2014;but one that teaches how to orchestrate the rebuilding of a technologically advanced civilization. If you suddenly found yourself without a working example, could you explain how to build an internal combustion engine, or a clock, or a microscope? Or, even more basic, how to successfully cultivate crops and make clothes? The apocalyptic scenarios I&#x2019;m presenting here are also the starting point for a thought experiment: they are a vehicle for examining the fundamentals of science and technology, which, as knowledge becomes ever more specialized, feel very remote to most of us.</p><p>People living in developed nations have become disconnected from the everyday processes of civilization that support them. Individually, we are astoundingly ignorant of even the basics of the production of food, shelter, clothes, medicine, materials, or vital substances. Our survival skills have atrophied to the point that much of humanity would be incapable of sustaining itself if the life-support system of modern civilization failed, if food no longer magically appeared on store shelves, or clothes on hangers. Of course, there was a time when everyone was a survivalist, with a far more intimate connection to the land and methods of production, and to survive in a post-apocalyptic world you&#x2019;d need to turn back the clock and relearn these core skills.*</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, each piece of modern technology we take for granted requires an enormous support network of other technologies. There&#x2019;s much more to making an iPhone than knowing the design and materials of each of its components. The device sits as the capstone on the very tip of a vast pyramid of enabling technologies: the mining and refining of the rare element indium for the touch screen, high-precision photolithographic manufacturing of microscopic circuitry in the computing processor chips, and the incredibly miniaturized components in the microphone, not to mention the network of cell phone towers and other infrastructure necessary to maintain telecommunications and the functioning of the phone. The first generation born after the Fall would find the internal mechanisms of a modern phone absolutely inscrutable, the pathways of its microchip circuits invisibly small to the human eye and their purpose utterly mysterious. The sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke said in 1961 that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. In the aftermath of the Fall, the rub is that this miraculous technology would have belonged not to some star-faring alien species, but to people just a generation in our own past.</p><p>Even quotidian artifacts of our civilization that aren&#x2019;t particularly high-tech still require a diversity of raw materials that must be mined or otherwise gathered, processed in specialized plants, and assembled in a manufacturing facility. And all of this in turn relies on electrical power stations and transport over great distances. This point is made very eloquently in Leonard E. Read&#x2019;s 1958 essay written from the perspective of one of our most basic tools, &#x201c;I, Pencil.&#x201d; The astounding conclusion is that because the sourcing of raw materials and the methods of production are so dispersed, there is not a single person on the face of the Earth who knows how to make even this simplest of implements.</p><p>A potent demonstration of the gulf that now separates our individual capabilities and the production of even simple gizmos in our everyday life was offered by Thomas Thwaites when, in 2008, he attempted to make a toaster from scratch while studying for his MA at the Royal College of Art. He reverse-engineered a cheap toaster down to its barest essentials&#x2014;iron frame, mica-mineral insulating sheets, nickel heating filaments, copper wires and plug, and plastic casing&#x2014;and then sourced all the raw materials himself, digging them out of the ground in quarries and mines. He also looked up simpler, historical metallurgical techniques, referring to a sixteenth-century text to build a rudimentary iron-smelting furnace using a metal trash can, barbecue coals, and a leaf blower for bellows. The finished model is satisfyingly primitive but also grotesquely beautiful in its own right and neatly underscores the core of our problem.</p><p>Of course, even in one of the extreme doomsday scenarios, groups of survivors would not need to become self-sufficient immediately. If the great majority of the population succumbed to an aggressive virus, there would still be vast resources left behind. The supermarkets would remain stocked with plentiful food, and you could pick up a fine new set of designer clothes from the deserted department stores or liberate from the showroom the sports car you&#x2019;ve always dreamed about. Find an abandoned mansion, and with a little foraging it wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to salvage some mobile diesel generators to keep the lighting, heating, and appliances running. Underground lakes of fuel remain beneath gas stations, sufficient to keep your new home and car functioning for a significant period. In fact, small groups of survivors could probably live pretty comfortably in the immediate aftermath of the Fall. For a while, civilization could coast on its own momentum. The survivors would find themselves surrounded by a wealth of resources there for the taking: a bountiful Garden of Eden.</p><p>But the Garden is rotting.</p><p>Food, clothes, medicines, machinery, and other technology inexorably decompose, decay, deteriorate, and degrade over time. The survivors are provided with nothing more than a grace period. With the collapse of civilization and the sudden arrest of key processes&#x2014;gathering raw materials, refining and manufacturing, transportation and distribution&#x2014;the hourglass is inverted and the sand steadily drains away. The remnants provide nothing more than a safety buffer to ease the transition to the moment when harvesting and manufacturing must begin anew.</p><p></p><p>A REBOOT MANUAL</p><p></p><p>The most profound problem facing survivors is that human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. No one individual knows enough to keep the vital processes of society going. Even if a skilled technician from a steel foundry survived, he would only know the details of <i>his</i> job, not the subsets of knowledge possessed by other workers at the foundry that are vital for keeping it running&#x2014;let alone how to mine iron ore or provide electricity to keep the plant operating. The most visible technology we use daily is just the tip of a vast iceberg&#x2014;not only in the sense that it&#x2019;s based on a great manufacturing and organizational network that supports production, but also because it represents the heritage of a long history of advances and developments. The iceberg extends unseen through both space and time.</p><p>So where would survivors turn? A great deal of information will certainly remain in the books gathering dust on the shelves of the now-deserted libraries, bookshops, and homes. The problem with this knowledge, however, is that it isn&#x2019;t presented in a way appropriate for helping a fledgling society&#x2014;or an individual without specialist training. What do you think you&#x2019;d understand if you just pulled a medical textbook off the shelf and flipped through the pages of terminology and drug names? University medical textbooks presuppose a huge amount of prior knowledge, and are designed to work alongside teaching and practical demonstrations from established experts. Even if there were doctors among the first generation of survivors, they&#x2019;d be severely limited in what they could accomplish without test results or the cornucopia of modern drugs they were trained to use&#x2014;drugs that would be degrading on pharmacy shelves or in defunct hospital storage refrigerators.</p><p>Much of this academic literature would itself be lost, perhaps to fires ripping unchecked through empty cities. Even worse, much of the wealth of new knowledge generated each year, including that which I and other scientists produce and consume in our own research, is not recorded on any durable medium at all. The cutting edge of human understanding exists primarily as ephemeral bits of data: as specialist journals&#x2019; academic &#x201c;papers&#x201d; stored on website servers.</p><p>And the books aimed at general readers wouldn&#x2019;t be much more help. Can you imagine a group of survivors who had access to only the selection of books stocked in an average store? How far would a civilization get trying to rebuild itself from the wisdom contained in the pages of self-help guides to succeeding in business management, thinking yourself thin, or reading the body language of the opposite sex? The most absurd nightmare would be a post-apocalyptic society discovering a few yellowed and crumbly books and, thinking them the scientific wisdom of the ancients, trying to apply homeopathy to curb a plague or astrology to forecast harvests. Even the books in the science section would offer little help. The latest pop-sci page-turner may be engagingly written, make clever metaphorical use of everyday observations, and leave the reader with a deeper understanding of some new research, but it probably won&#x2019;t yield much pragmatic knowledge. In short, the vast majority of our collective wisdom would not be accessible&#x2014;at least in a usable form&#x2014;to the survivors of a cataclysm. So how best to help the survivors? What key information would a guidebook need to deliver, and how might it be structured?</p><p>I&#x2019;m not the first person to wrestle with this question. James Lovelock is a scientist with a formidable track record for striking at the heart of an issue long before his peers. He is most famous for his Gaia hypothesis, which posits that the entire planet&#x2014;a complex assemblage of rocky crust and oceans and swirling atmosphere, along with the thin smear of life that has established itself across the surface&#x2014;can be understood as a single entity that acts to damp down instabilities and self-regulate its environment over billions of years. Lovelock is deeply concerned that one element of this system, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, now has the capacity to disrupt these natural checks and balances with devastating effect.</p><p>Lovelock draws on a biological analogy to explain how we might safeguard our heritage: &#x201c;Organisms that face desiccation often encapsulate their genes in spores so that the information for their renewal is carried through the drought.&#x201d; The human equivalent envisaged by Lovelock is a book for all seasons, &#x201c;a primer on science, clearly written and unambiguous in its meaning&#x2014;a primer for anyone interested in the state of the Earth and how to survive and live well on it.&#x201d; What he proposes is a truly massive undertaking: recording the complete assemblage of human knowledge in a huge textbook&#x2014;a document that you could, at least in principle, read from cover to cover, and then walk away knowing the essentials of everything that is now known.</p><p>In fact, the idea of a &#x201c;total book&#x201d; has a much longer history. In the past, encyclopedia compilers appreciated far more acutely than we do today the fragility of even great civilizations, and the exquisite value of the scientific knowledge and practical skills held in the minds of the population that evaporate once the society collapses. Denis Diderot explicitly regarded his <i>Encyclop�die</i>, published between 1751 and 1772, as a safe repository of human knowledge, preserving it for posterity in case of a cataclysm that snuffs our civilization as the ancient cultures of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had all been lost, leaving behind only random surviving fragments of their writing. In this way, the encyclopedia becomes a time capsule of accumulated knowledge, all of it arranged logically and cross-referenced, protected against the erosion of time in case of a widespread catastrophe.</p><p>Since the Enlightenment our understanding of the world has increased exponentially, and the task of compiling a complete compendium of human knowledge would be orders of magnitude harder today. The creation of such a &#x201c;total book&#x201d; would represent a modern-era pyramid-building project, consuming the full-time exertion of tens of thousands of people over many years. The purpose of this toil would be to ensure not the safe passage of a pharaoh to eternal bliss in the afterworld, but the immortality of our civilization itself.</p><p>Such an all-consuming undertaking is not inconceivable if the will is ...</p></p><h2>The Call</h2><p>Told in the form of a fictional biography, this account of the life and vocation of David Treadup, a New York farm boy who becomes a missionary to China, portrays the history of China in this century</p><p></p><h2>Chess Openings for Black, Explained (A Complete Repertoire)</h2><p><b>This series shows you how to start your chess games as dynamically and accurately as the greatest grandmasters in the world.</b> Three-time US Champion Champion Lev Alburt, famous for his ability to turn aspiring players into masters, teams up with two-time U.S. Champion Roman Dzindzichashvili and young international star Eugene Perelshteyn to give you a complete repertoire of opening play-as well as a review of all openings and an explanation of the principles of playing this crucial stage of the game.

Taylor invented what became known as "Scientific Management," or simply "Taylorism," an approach to organizing factories and offices that placed workers within a rigid system designed for maximum productivity. Taylor broke down the machinery and management of industrialization, measuring each movement with stopwatch precision to deduce how the whole could operate more efficiently. A man perfectly suited to his times, he lived during the peak of the Industrial Revolution, providing him a grand stage for displaying his ideas. Today his legacy may be viewed by some as a sort of curse; the modern workplace he helped to create pits employees in a race against the clock, virtual slaves to a system created nearly a century ago. <i>The One Best Way</i> is a fascinating history of the man who revolutionized the way we do business and, in turn, the way we live.&#34;In the past man has been first. In the future the System will be first&#34;, predicted Frederick Winslow Taylor, the first efficiency expert and model for all the stopwatch-clicking engineers who stalk the factories and offices of the industrial world. In 1874, eighteen-year-old Taylor abandoned his wealthy family&#39;s plans for him to attend Harvard, and instead went to work as a lowly apprentice in a Philadelphia machine shop, shuttling between the manicured hedges of his family&#39;s home and the hot, cussing, dirty world of the shop floor. As he rose through the ranks of management, he began the time-and-motion studies for which he would become famous, and forged his industrial philosophy, Scientific Management. To organized labor, Taylor was a slave-driver. To the bosses, he was an eccentric who raised wages while ruling the factory floor with a stopwatch. To himself, he was a misunderstood visionary who, under the banner of Science, would confer prosperity on all and abolish the old class hatreds. To millions today who feel they give up too much to their jobs, Taylor is the source of that fierce, unholy obsession with &#34;efficiency&#34; that marks modern life. The assembly line; the layout of our kitchens; the ways our libraries, fastfood restaurants, and even our churches are organized all owe much to this driven man, who broke every job into its parts, sliced and trimmed and timed them, and remolded what was left into the work of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Reflections on the Revolution in France &amp; The Rights of Man</h2><p>Edmund Burke was a statesman and philosopher who favored gradual reform over revolution. Arguing that the ideology behind the French Revolution was too ephemeral, he predicted a disastrous outcome. Well regarded by the liberals of his day for his support of constitutional limitations on sovereign authority, his condemnation of religious persecution, and his sympathy for the grievances of the American colonists, Burke also gained the respect of conservatives when he published his &#34;Reflections on the Revolution in France&#34; in 1790. One of Paine&#39;s greatest and most widely read works, considered a classic statement of faith in democracy and egalitarianism, defends the early events of the French Revolution, supports social security for workers, public employment for those in need of work, abolition of laws limiting wages, and other social reforms.</p><p></p><h2>Patchwork Portfolio : A Presentation of 165 Original Quilt Designs</h2><p>Quilters who need a creative shot in the arm will appreciate this book&#39;s original designs and easy-to-follow instructions.

In The Sorrows of Empire, he explored the ways in which the growth of American militarism and the garrisoning of the planet have jeopardized our stability. Now, in <i>Nemesis</i>, he shows how imperial overstretch is undermining the republic itself, both economically and politically.<br>Delving into new areas--from plans to militarize outer space to Constitution-breaking presidential activities at home and the devastating corruption of a toothless Congress--<i>Nemesis</i> offers a striking description of the trap into which the dreams of America's leaders have taken us. Drawing comparisons to empires past, Johnson explores in vivid detail just what the unintended consequences of our dependence on a permanent war economy are likely to be.

Or when the globe's sole "hyperpower," no longer capable of paying for the vaulting ambitions of its leaders, becomes the greatest hyper-debtor of all times? <br>In his stunning conclusion, Johnson suggests that financial bankruptcy could herald the breakdown of constitutional government in America--a crisis that may ultimately prove to be the only path to a renewed nation.</p><p>Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research Institute, is the author of the bestselling <i>Blowback</i> and <i>The Sorrows of Empire</i>.

Some believe this resolution was only symbolic, designed to show national resolve. But I could not ignore that it provided explicit authority, under the War Powers Resolution and the Constitution, to go to war. It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events--anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration. I could not support such a grant of war-making authority to the president; I believe it would put more innocent lives at risk.<br>&nbsp;<br>--Congresswoman Barbara Lee ([Democrat from California], the <br>only member of Congress to vote against the transfer of the war <br>power to the president for the invasion of Afghanistan), <br>San Francisco Chronicle, September 23, 2001<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the oddest features of political life in the United States in the years since the terrorist attacks is how few people have thought or acted like Barbara Lee. The public expresses itself in opinion polls, which some students of politics scrutinize intently, but there is little passion in the society, certainly none proportionate to the threats facing our democratic republic. The United States today is like a cruise ship on the Niagara River upstream of the most spectacular falls in North America. A few people on board have begun to pick up a slight hiss in the background, to observe a faint haze of mist in the air or on their glasses, to note that the river current seems to be running slightly faster. But no one yet seems to have realized that it is almost too late to head for shore.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the Chinese, Ottoman, Hapsburg, imperial German, Nazi, imperial Japanese, British, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Soviet empires in the last century, we are approaching the edge of a huge waterfall and are about to plunge over it.<br>&nbsp;<br>If the American democratic system is no longer working as planned, if the constitutional checks and balances as well as other structures put in place by the founders to prevent tyranny are increasingly less operational, we have not completely lacked for witnesses of every stripe, domestic and foreign. General Tommy Franks, commander of the American assault on Baghdad, for instance, went so far as to predict that another serious terrorist attack on the United States would "begin to unravel the fabric of our Constitution," and under such circumstances, he was open to the idea that "the Constitution could be scrapped in favor of a military form of government."1 The historian Kevin Baker feared that we are no longer far from the day when, like the Roman Senate in 27 bc, our Congress will take its last meaningful vote and turn over power to a military dictator. "In the end, we'll beg for the coup," he wrote.2<br>&nbsp;<br>On October 10, 2002, Senator Robert Byrd (Democrat from West Virginia) asked plaintively about the separation of powers, "Why are we being hounded into action on a resolution that turns over to President Bush the Congress's Constitutional power to declare war? . . . The judgment of history will not be kind to us if we take this step."3 Nonetheless, the following day, the resolution carried by a 77-23 vote in the Senate and 296-133 in the House of Representatives. The Berkshire Eagle editorialized, "The Senate, which was designed by the framers of the Constitution to act as a brake on the popular passions of the day, was little more than a speed bump under the White House steamroller."4 The libertarian writer Bill Winter conjectured that the problem was "the monarchization of America under Bush."5 Adam Young, a Canadian political commentator, wondered, "How did the chief magistrate of a confederated republic degrade into the global tyrant we experience today, part secular pope, part military despot, part pseudo-philosopher-king and full-time overbearing global gangster?"6 Indeed, that is the question for all of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Former British foreign secretary Robin Cook noted that "[a]ll the checks and balances that the founding fathers constructed to restrain presidential power are broken instruments." Cook observed the hubris and megalomania that flowed from this in John Bolton, then the number three official at the State Department (subsequently ambassador to the United Nations). When asked about possible incentives that might cause Iran to end its nuclear ambitions, Bolton replied, "I don't do carrots." Cook accurately predicted that members of the Bush administration "will . . . celebrate their [2004] election victory by putting [the Iraqi city of] Fallujah to the torch," as they did that very November.7<br>&nbsp;<br>Marine general Anthony Zinni, General Franks's predecessor as Centcom commander in the Middle East, worried about the way the Pentagon was further expanding its powers at the expense of other agencies of government. "Why the hell," he asked, "would the Department of Defense be the organization in our government that deals with the reconstruction of Iraq? Doesn't make sense."8 One anonymous foreign service officer supplied an answer to Los Angeles Times reporter Sonni Efron, "I just wake up in the morning and tell myself, 'There's been a military coup,' and then it all makes sense."9 Even the president himself was a witness of sorts to the changes under way, baldly asserting at a White House press conference on April 13, 2004, that he was "the ultimate decision-maker for this country"--a notion that would have appalled the authors of the Constitution.10<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have led the country into a perilous cul-de-sac, but they did not do it alone and removing them from office will not necessarily solve the problem. The crisis of government in the United States has been building at least since World War II. The emergence of the imperial presidency and the atrophying of the legislative and judicial branches have deep roots in the postwar military-industrial complex, in the way broad sectors of the public have accepted the military as our most effective public institution, and in aberrations in our electoral system. The interesting issue is not the damage done by Bush, Cheney, and their followers but how they were able to get away with it, given the barriers that exist in the Constitution to prevent just the sorts of misuses of power for which they have become notorious.<br>&nbsp;<br>Historian Carol Berkin in her book A Brilliant Solution: Inventing the Constitution argues that the nation's "Founders--including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania and dozens of others--envisioned a supreme legislative branch as the heart and soul of America's central government. . . . America's modern presidency, with all its trappings, would be unimaginable to men like Madison, Washington, and Franklin. Of all those historic figures at the 1787 [Constitutional] Convention, perhaps only Alexander Hamilton would relish today's playing of 'Hail to the Chief.' "11<br>&nbsp;<br>The intent of the founders was to prevent a recurrence of the tyranny they had endured under Britain's King George III. They bent all their ingenuity and practical experience to preventing tyrannies of one, of the few, of a majority, of the monied classes, or of any other group that might obtain and exercise unchecked power, often adopting institutional precedents from the Roman Republic. Inspired by the French political philosopher Montesquieu's discussion of the "separation of powers" in his On the Spirit of the Laws, published in 1748, the drafters of the American Constitution produced a sophisticated scheme to balance power in a republic. The most basic structure they chose was federalism, setting up the states as alternatives to and limitations on the power of the national government. Congress was given that quintessential parliamentary power--control of the budget--without which it would be merely an ornamental body like the "people's congresses" in communist-dominated countries. Congress was also charged with initiating all legislation, making the final decision to go to war, and if necessary getting rid of an unsatisfactory president by impeachment, something also achievable through periodic elections. To moderate the power of Congress somewhat, the Constitution divided it into two quite differently elected and apportioned houses, each capable of vetoing the other's decisions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Both houses of Congress must ultimately pass all laws, and the president, who is entrusted with implementing them, is given a veto as well. The Congress, in turn, can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote, and even when Congress and the president agree on a law, the Supreme Court, exercising the function of interpreting the laws, can still declare it unconstitutional. The president and members of Congress must be re-elected or leave office, but judges serve for life, although Congress can impeach them. The president nominates the heads of the cabinet departments, who serve at his pleasure, as well as all judges, but the Senate must approve them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over time, this balance-of-power spirit came to influence other institutions of government that the Constitution did not mention, including the armed forces, where competition among the services--the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps--dilutes somewhat the enormous coercive power entrusted to them.12 To prevent a tyranny of the majority, the Constitution authorizes fixed terms and fixed times for elections (borrowed from the Roman Republic) as a way to interfere with the monopolization of power by an individual, an oligarchy, or a political party.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, after more than two centuries (about the same length of time that the Roman Republic was in its prime), this framework has almost completely disintegrated. For those who believe that the structure of government in Washington today bears some resemblance to that outlined in the Constitution of 1787, the burden of proof is on them. The president now dominates the government in a way no ordinary monarch possibly could. He has at his disposal the clandestine services of the CIA, a private army unaccountable to the Congress, the press, or the public because everything it does is secret. No president since Harry Truman, having discovered what unlimited power the CIA affords him, has ever failed to use it. Meanwhile, the "defense" budgets of the Pentagon dwarf those of the rest of the government and have undermined democratic decision making in the process. Funds for military hardware are distributed in as many states as possible to ensure that any member of Congress who might consider voting against a new weapons system would be accused of putting some of his constituents out of work.<br>&nbsp;<br>When in May 2005, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld listed a large number of unneeded domestic military bases that he wanted to close as an economy measure, the affected communities promptly erupted in protest and began frantic lobbying efforts to "save" their particular installations. Advocates of keeping the bases open phrase their arguments in terms of national security, but the true reason is jobs, jobs, jobs.13 As the philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote at the height of the Cold War, "It is no secret that the billions of dollars demanded by the Pentagon for the armaments industry are necessary not for 'national security' but for keeping the economy from collapsing."14<br>&nbsp;<br>"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance." It is not precisely clear who first spoke these immortal words--Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, or the antislavery abolitionist Wendell Phillips--but during the Cold War and its aftermath, Americans were not particularly vigilant when it came to excessive concentration of power in the presidency and its appendages, and we are now paying a very high price for that. From the founding of the republic to the moment of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address in 1961, some of our leaders have warned us that the greatest threat to our republican structure of government is war, including its associated maladies of standing armies, a military-industrial complex, and all the vested interests that develop around a massive military establishment.<br>&nbsp;<br>The classic statement of this threat was by the chief author of the Constitution, James Madison:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Of all the enemies of true liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manner and of morals, engendered in both. No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. . . . War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement. In war, a physical force is to be created; and it is the executive will, which is to direct it. In war, the public treasuries are to be unlocked; and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them. In war, the honors and emoluments of office are to be multiplied; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed; and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venal love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace.15<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The United States has been continuously engaged in or mobilized for war since 1941. Using statistics compiled by the Federation of American Scientists, Gore Vidal has listed 201 overseas military operations between the end of World War II and September 11, 2001, in which the United States struck the first blow. Among these, a typical example was Operation Urgent Fury in 1983, "Reagan's attack on the island of Grenada, a month-long caper that General [Alexander M.] Haig disloyally said could have been handled more efficiently by the Provincetown police department."16 Excluding minor military operations, Drexel University historian and political scientist Michael Sullivan counts only "invasions, interventions, and regime changes since World War II" and comes up with thirty bloody, often clandestine, American wars from Greece (1947-49) to Yugoslavia (1995 and 1999).17 Neither of these compilations included the wars in Afghanistan (2001-) and Iraq (2003-).<br>&nbsp;<br>It should be noted that since 1947, while we have used our military power for political and military gain in a...</p><h2>Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates (Complete and Unabridged)</h2><p><p>From glistening ice roads to frozen canals, in a wonderland where even the richest nobles thrill to the gliding joys of winter, <i>everyone</i> is awaiting the fabulous race to win the magnificent Silver Skates --</p><p><i>Except Hans Brinker and his sister Gretel. </i>For the Brinkers are desperately poor, friendless; with a father felled by a crippling head wound, Mother and the children must battle simply to survive.

The book contains 60-65 color photographs. Each fly profile is listed with its creator's authentic recipe and tying tips. Also included are tying sequences for important patterns, a discussion of design trends, a materials glossary, and a list of sources for materials, custom flies, and off-the-shelf patterns. Dick Brown does not forget to describe fly selection for different destinations, habitats, and conditions, and to advise anglers on how to present flies and what prey they portray.&nbsp;<p>Dick Brown began chasing bonefish with a fly rod on his first trip to the Bahamas in the late 1970s. Two decades later&#x2015;after stalking his favorite quarry on saltwater flats around the world&#x2015;he wrote Fly Fishing for Bonefish, published by Nick Lyons in 1992. The book was immediately dubbed as the bible on all things bonefish and hailed by reviewers and angling experts alike for its encyclopedic coverage of this great game fish. A new all-color fully revised edition is now available, complete with the latest prey and behavior research, angling techniques, fly patterns, flats destinations, and equipment. </p><p>A new, updated edition of his second book, Bonefish Fly Patterns, is now available. It features detailed profiles, pattern recipes, and color photos of the best 197 bonefish flies ever created. The first edition of this pattern book became something of a flats fishing and fly tying cult classic for its comprehensive profiles that showed not only how to tie each fly but how and where to fish them. And the new edition includes 47 more flats flies! The book's colorful array of fly contributors&#x2015;which includes some of the world's most experienced flats guides, anglers, and bonefish world record holders&#x2015;made it worth reading for their insightful anecdotes alone. These include anglers, guides, and tiers such as Adams, Baine, Bevans, Borski, Boyle, Brewster, Chocklett, Clouser, Cowen, Dorsy, Ebanks, Gaspeny, Glinton, Hall, Haselau, Lambot, Peterson, Simonsen,Skok, Tomchin, Trodella, and Roselione-Valadez.</p><p>Today, Dick writes for many fishing, fly fishing, and outdoor magazines, and he gives slide shows, tying demonstrations and how-to clinics at fly fishing exhibitions, fishing clubs, and fly fishing retailer events.</p></p><h2>H�gar the Horrible: The Epic Chronicles: The Dailies 1977-1978</h2><p>The continuing epic quests of Hagar the Horrible are collected in another glorious booty-ful archive edition! <br><br>Reprinting every daily strip from July 1977 to December 1978, all of your favourite oddballs, misfits and miscreants are here, including sidekick Lucky Eddie and long-suffering wife Helga.

The first is that three hundred years ago, when Thomas Newcomen invented the steam engine, he was un�knowingly beginning what Lovelock calls &#x201c;accelerated evolu�tion,&#x201d; a process that is bringing about change on our planet roughly a million times faster than Darwinian evolution. The second is that as part of this process, humanity has the capacity to become the intelligent part of Gaia, the self-regulating earth system whose discovery Lovelock first an�nounced nearly fifty years ago. &nbsp;A Rough Ride to the Future is also an intellectual autobiography, in which Lovelock reflects on his life as a lone scientist, and asks&#x2015;eloquently&#x2015;whether his career trajec�tory is possible in an age of increased bureaucratization. &nbsp;We are now changing the atmosphere again, and Lovelock argues that there is little that can be done about this. But instead of feeling guilty, we should recognize what is happening, prepare for change, and ensure that we survive as a species so we can contribute to&#x2015;perhaps even guide&#x2015;the next evolution of Gaia. The road will be rough, but if we are smart enough, life will continue on earth in some form far into the future.</p><p>James Lovelock is the originator of the Gaia Hypothesis (now Gaia Theory), on which he has written several books, including The Revenge of Gaia and The Vanishing Face of Gaia.

In Japan, one goes there to cleanse the soul. Bathing in Japan is about much more than cleanliness: it is about family and community. It is about being alone and contemplative, time to watch the moon rise above the garden. Along with sixty full-color illustrations of the light and airy baths themselves, The Japanese Bath, delves into the aesthetic of bathing Japanese style and the innate beauty of the steps surrounding the process. The authors explain how to create a Japanese bath in your own home. A Zen meditation, the Japanese bath, indeed, cleanses the soul, and one emerges refreshed, renewed, and serene.</p><p>Contents Acknowledgments Introduction Bathing Entry The Datsuiba The Outside within the Inside Created Scenery Color With Darkness and Without Yuagari (afte bath) and Yusuzumi (enjoying the cool of the evening) Without Silence Bathing Japanese Style With and Without Clothing The Time of the Day Materials About Wood The Tools of Bathing Bathing Together Glossary ResourcesTime to watch the moon rise over the garden--the aesthetic of the Japanese bath exquisitely captured in photgraphy and text.</p><h2>Men of Respect: A Social History of the Sicilian Mafia</h2><p>Using records of the Italian government&#39;s recent inquiry into the Mafia, this history shows the crime organization&#39;s beginnings as a group of cattle rustlers in nineteenth-century Sicily and traces its growth to global dimensions</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: ItalianWritten by an Italian professor, this is an insightful sociological analysis of the special cultural, economic, and political features of Sicilian life that produced the Mafia. Initially, the nascent Mafia served the landowning ruling class by mediating its relations with the peasants. Latent during the Fascist period, the Mafia successfully manipulated the governing Christian Democratic Party after World War II. Expanding into drugs and urban ventures, the Sicilian Mafia is more powerful and deep-rooted than its American cousin. No less violent (it is credited with 150 murders in 1982), it does not balk at killing public figures as well as its own members. Heavily weighted toward the theoretical, this book is recommended for research collections. Lay readers or those interested in the Sicily-U.S. Mafia connection would likely prefer Claire Sterling's Octopus ( LJ 1/90).<br><i>- Gregor A.

It also introduces a large Victorian house in Shadyside (a Pittsburgh neighborhood) and a middle-class way of life at the turn of the century.</p><p>Mr. Spencer, who worked--not very happily--for Henry Clay Frick, was one of the growing number of middle-management employees in American industrial cities in the 1880s and 1890s. His income, which supported his family of nine, a cook, two regular nurses, and at times a wet nurse and her baby, guaranteed a comfortable life but not a luxurious one. In the words of the editors, the Spencers represent a class that "too often stands silent or stereotyped as we rush forward toward the greater glamour of the robber barons or their immigrant workers."</p><p>Through the eyes of Ethel Spencer, the third daughter, we are led with warmth and humor through the routine of everyday life in this household: school, play, church on Sundays, illness, family celebrations, and vacations. Ethel was an observant child, with little sentimentality, and she wrote her memoir in later life as a professor of English with a gift for clear prose and the instincts of an anthropologist. As the editors observe, her memoir is "a fascinating insight into one kind of urban life of three generations ago."</p></p><p><b>Ethel Spencer</b> (1889-1966)&nbsp; graduated from Radcliffe College and did graduate work at St. Hilda's Oxford. Later she was a professor of English at Carnegie Tech from 1920 to 1955 (now Carnegie Mellon University), and was the&nbsp;head of the Department of General Studies when she retired. The third of seven children of Charles Hart Spencer&nbsp; (1852-1912) and Mary Acheson Spencer (1863-1950);&nbsp;upper middle-class, Presbyterian,&nbsp;Pittsburghers, who raised their family in (then) suburban Shadyside&nbsp;at the&nbsp;turn of the 19th century. Her family lived on Amberson Avenue until the death of Mary Spencer in&nbsp;1950.&nbsp;<br><br> Michael P. Weber and Peter N. Stearns, who edited the memoir and wrote the introduction, are historians in the Department of History and Philosophy, Carnegie-Mellon University."Of course we all wore hand-me-downs.&nbsp; A dress that began with Adeline, traveled down to Kate, then to me, to Mary, to Elizabeth, provided it was made of stout enough material to hold out until it reached the youngest....&nbsp; The Spanish dress {happened to be} made for me while the Spanish war was in progress--a red and yellow gingham, the colors of Spain.&nbsp; How my patriotic soul hated that dress!&nbsp; My schoolmates teased me every time I wore it, called me Spanish, implied that I was a traitor; but I had to wear it anyway.&nbsp; And when I thankfully outgrew it, it passed to Mary and then to Elizabeth carrying with it a heavy load of built-in hatred.&nbsp; I don't think my little sisters had the faintest idea why it was hateful, but they loyally hated it anyway."&nbsp;</p><h2>From Junk Food to Joy Food: All the Foods You Love to Eat...Only Better</h2><p>We all want to look and feel better, but where&#x2019;s the fun in nibbling on boring salads and choking down steamed broccoli?

Living in the South in the not-so-distant past, the Logans are the only black family to own farmland, while most of their black neighbors are sharecroppers on white-owned land. But where did this valuable legacy come from?</p><p> The story begins with Paul-Edward Logan, grandfather of Cassie Logan, the beloved protagonist of Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning <b>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</b>. Born during the Civil War, Paul-Edward is the son of a white plantation owner and a former slave. Though not an unusual heritage, his upbringing is. Paul-Edward&#x2019;s white father sees to it that he and his sister have many of the privileges their white half-brothers enjoy. But at fourteen, Paul-Edward runs away to seek his fortune. His story is filled with exciting, sometimes heart-breaking adventures, and what is most amazing, his dream of land-ownership, almost impossible for a black person to accomplish in the post&#x2013;Civil War South, becomes reality.</p><p> The Land, like all the books in this award-winning series, is based on the experiences of the Taylor family, bringing historical truth and power to this awe-inspiring story. </p><p></p><p></p></p><p><i>The Land</i> is Mildred D. Taylor's wonderful prequel to her Newbery Medal winner, <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>. In the stories Taylor has to tell, life is not fair, hard work doesn't always pay off, and the good guy doesn't always win. That's because this extraordinary author tells the stories of her African American family in the Deep South during and after the Civil War, a time of ugly, painful racism. <p> Paul-Edward Logan, the son of a white, plantation-owner father and a slave mother, is our narrator, bound and determined to buy his own land and shape his own future at whatever cost. Caught between black and white worlds and not fitting into either one is devastating for him, but his powerful, engaging tales of the love of family, the strength of friendship, and growing up will inspire anyone to dare to persevere despite terrible odds. Taylor's books are not only essential in understanding what led up to the Civil Rights movement in America--they are also breathtaking page-turners, full of suspense, humor, love, and hope. <i>The Land</i> certainly stands alone, but the other award-winning tales of the Logan family--<i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>; <i>Let the Circle Be Unbroken</i>; and <i>The Road to Memphis</i>--are excellent as well.

He&#39;s won multiple Eisners, a Harvey, and an Inkpot award.The Norwegian French master of the noir graphic novel deploys a more-or-less full palette, albeit very tonally subdued (don't expect blood reds or sky blues), and several panels whose perspectives are as much as 30 degrees from the horizontal (hitherto a rarity in his work) to tell a story that an only slightly less gloomy David Goodis might have written. Alex is in seriously dumped condition. His friend Claude shows up to ask him to water the plants while he's out of town. He does and one time sees a man in the apartment across the street. When Claude gets back, Alex goes to see him, only to wind up framed for murder and on the run. A woman shopkeeper recognizes him, believes his story, and takes him to her place. The pair fall in love as Alex sleuths his own case. Things just might work out, but . . . Jason's tall, thin, expressionally limited, animal-headed figures seem downright Bogey-and-Baby-ish in this ever-so-satisfying, archetypal exercise in romantic fatalism. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the author of The Mediterranean Kitchen. 35,000 first printing. $60,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>The title of this ambitious work by Goldstein ( The Mediterranean Kitchen ) reflects the name of her now rather famous San Francisco establishment, a comfortable, open-kitchen eatery where an eclectic mix of ethnic and American foods is artfully and often playfully presented. At the root of restaurant and book alike is Goldstein's vision of the chef's role as "artist, interpreter, and caretaker of cultural artworks we call recipes." Familiar classics (Passover sponge cake, persimmon pudding and gefilte fish), however, are the exceptions in a collection where an Italian fritto misto is given a subcontinental twist (and called Indian fritto misto al mare), where Caesar salad becomes a sauce for pasta, and where a crabmeat, corn and spinach risotto--Italian in origin--is embellished with Oriental flavors. Other interesting creations include a "jambalaya risotto" with shrimp, scallops, ham and smoked sausage; fish with tahini, cilantro and cayenne; and "cannoli of dreams," Italian fried pastries filled with sweetened mascarpone and ricotta, bing cherries, semisweet chocolate, lemon and tangarine peels. The result is an enticing array of multicultural recipes that are relatively simple to cook and fascinating to read. Illustrations, by Goldstein's daughter Rachel, not seen by PW.

He lives in London with his wife.The Gone-Away World<br><br>The lights went out in the Nameless Bar just after nine. I was bent over the pool table with one hand in the bald patch behind the D, which Flynn the Barman claimed was beer, but which was the same size and shape as Mrs. Flynn the Barman's arse: nigh on a yard in the beam and formed like the cross-section of a cooking apple. The fluorescent over the table blinked out, then came back, and the glass-fronted fridge gave a low, lurching hum. The wiring buzzed&#x2014;and then it was dark. A faint sheen of static danced on the TV on its shelf, and the green exit lamp sputtered by the door.<br><br>I dropped my weight into the imprint of Mrs. Flynn the Barman's hams and played the shot anyway. The white ball whispered across the felt, came off two cushions, and clipped the eight cleanly into a side pocket. Doff, doff, tchk . . . glonk. It was perfect. On the other hand, I'd been aiming for the six. I'd given the game to Jim Hepsobah, and any time now when the power came back and everything was normal in the Nameless Bar, I'd pass the cue to my hero pal Gonzo, and Jim would beat him too.<br><br>Any time now.<br><br>Except that the lights stayed out, and the hollow glimmer of the TV set faded away. There was a small, quiet moment, the kind you just have time to notice, which makes you feel sad for no good reason. Then Flynn went out back, swearing like billy-o&#x2014;and if your man Billy-O ever met Flynn, if ever there was a cuss-off, a high noon kinduva thing with foul language, I know where my money'd be.<br><br>Flynn hooked up the generator, which God help us was pig-powered. There was the sound of four large, foul-smelling desert swine being yoked to a capstan, a noise pretty much like a minor cavalry war, and then Flynn let loose some of his most abominable profanity at the nearest porker. It looked as if it wanted to vomit and bolted. The others perforce followed it in a slow but steady progression about the capstan, and then pig number one came back around, saw Flynn ready with another dose and tried to stop. Lashed to the crosspiece and bundled along by its three fellows, it found it couldn't, so it gathered its flabcovered self and charged past him at piggy top speed, and the whole cycle accelerated until, with a malodorous, oinking crunch, the generator kicked in, and the television lit up with the bad news.<br><br>Or rather, it didn't light up. The picture was so dim that it seemed the set was broken. Then there were fireworks and cries of alarm and fear, very quiet but getting louder, and we realised Sally Culpepper was just now turning on the sound. The image shook and veered, and urgent men went past shouting get back, get clear, and ohshitlookatthatfuckerjesus, which they didn't even bother to bleep. In the middle distance, it looked as if maybe a figure was rolling on the ground. Something had gone absolutely, horribly awry in the world, and naturally some arsehole was present with a camera making himself 10k an hour hazard pay when he could have been rolling up his arsehole sleeves and saving a life or two. I knew a guy in the Go Away War who did just that, dumped the network's prized Digi VII in a latrine trench and hauled six civilians and a sergeant from a burning medical truck. Got the Queen's Honour back home and a P45 from his boss. He's in an institution now, is Micah Monroe, and every day two guys from the Veterans' Hospital come by and take him for a walk and make sure the medal's polished on its little stand by his bed. They're sweet old geezers, Harry and Hoyle, and they've got medals of their own and they figure it's the least they can do for a man who lost his mind to giving a damn. Harry's kid was in the medical truck, you see. One of the ones Micah couldn't reach.<br><br>We stared at the screen and tried to make sense of what was on it. It looked, for a moment, as if the Jorgmund Pipe was on fire&#x2014;but that was like saying the sky was falling. The Pipe was the most solidly constructed, triple-redundant, safety-first, one-of-a-kind necessary object in the world. We built it fast and dirty, because there was no other way, the gone-away world and then after that we made it indestructible. The plans were drawn up by the best, then checked and re-checked by the very best, and then the checkers themselves were scrutinised, analysed and vetted for any sign of fifth columnism or martyr tendencies, or even a serious and hitherto undetected case of just-plain-stupid, and then the contractors went to work under a scheme which emphasised thoroughness and adherence to spec over swift completion, and which imposed penalties so dire upon speculators and profiteers that it would actually be safer just to throw yourself from a high place, and finally the quantity surveyors and catastrophe experts went to town on it with hammers and saws, lightning generators and torsion engines, and declared it sound. Everyone in the Livable Zone was united in the desire to maintain and safeguard it. There was absolutely no chance that it could imaginably, conceivably, possibly be on fire.<br><br>It was on fire in a big way. The Pipe was burning painful white, magnesium, corpse-belly, nauseating white, and beside it there were buildings and fences, which meant this wasn't just the Pipe, but something even more important: a pumping station or a refinery. The whole place was wrapped in hot, shining smoke, and deep in the heart of the furnace there was stuff going on the human eye didn't know what to do with, weird, bad-news stuff which came with its own ominous soundtrack. On the screen something very important crumbled into noise and light.<br><br>"Fuuuuuuck," said Gonzo William Lubitsch, speaking for everyone.<br><br>It was a funny feeling: we were looking at the end of the world&#x2014; again&#x2014;and we were looking at something awful we'd never wanted to see, but at the same time we were looking at fame and fortune and just about everything we could ever ask for delivered by a grateful populace. We were looking at our reason for being. Because that thar on that thar screen was a fire, plus also a toxic event of the worst kind, and we, Ladies and Gentlemen, put your hands together, were the Haulage &amp; HazMat Emergency Civil Freebooting Company of Exmoor County (corporate HQ the Nameless Bar, CEO Sally J. Culpepper, presiding) and this was the thing that we did better than anyone else in the entire Livable Zone, and therefore anywhere. Sally was straightaway talking to Jim Hepsobah and then to Gonzo, making lists and giving orders. <br><br>She set Flynn the Barman to brewing his chews-through-steel espresso, and at last even Mrs. Flynn was up off her on-board cushions and moving at flank speed to make provisions, prepare tallies, and take letters for loved ones and estranged ones and people glimpsed and admired across the floating ash of the Nameless Bar. We ran to and fro and bumped into one another and swore, mostly because we didn't have anything important to do yet, and there was hubbub and brouhaha until Sally jumped up on the pool table and told us to shut up and get it together. She raised her phone above our heads like the thigh bone of a saint.<br><br>Sally Culpepper was six feet tall and much of her was leg, and on her right shoulder blade she had an orchid tattoo inked by some kid a quarter-inch shy of Michelangelo. She had strawberry lips and creamy skin and freckles across her nose where it'd been rebuilt after a bar fight in Lisbon. Gonzo claimed to have slept with her, to have had those legs wrapped around his hips like conjoined Italian calf-skin boa constrictors. He said she left him all but dead and grinning like a crescent moon. He said it happened one night after a big job, beer running from the rafters and everyone shiny as an egg yolk with success and soap-scoured skin. He said it was that time when Jim and Sally were trying not to be a thing, before they just gave in to the inevitable and got a place together. Every time we all met up, me and Gonzo and Sally and Jim Hepsobah and the others, Gonzo'd throw her a wicked grin and ask her how her other tattoo was, and Sally Culpepper would smile a secret smile which said she wasn't telling, and maybe he knew what that other tattoo looked like and maybe he didn't. Jim Hepsobah just pretended he hadn't heard, because Jim loved Gonzo like a brother, and love like that recognises that your buddy can be an ass, and doesn't care. We all loved Sally Culpepper, and she ruled us with her transparent lashes and her milkmaid's face and her slender arms that could drop a punch on you like a steam hammer. So there she stood, and there was a reasonable facsimile of calm and attention, because we knew that if the call came it would come on that phone, and we knew she had five-offive reception here, and that was one of the reasons why the Nameless Bar was our place of business.<br><br>So we stopped hunting for lost socks and packing bags, and fretting that we'd somehow miss the starting gun, and settled in to Mrs. Flynn's provender. After a while we got quietly chatty and talked about small domestic chores, like cleaning gutters and chasing bats out of the loft. When the phone did ring (any time now), we could go and be heroes and save the world, which was Gonzo's favourite thing, and perforce something I did from time to time as well. Until it kicked off, we might as well not fuss. And then the Nameless Bar went quiet again; in little groups and one by one we fell silent as we beheld a vision of awful destiny.<br><br>The vision took the form of a small child carrying a snot-crusted and elderly teddy bear. It marched out into the room with much gravitas, surveyed us all sternly, then turned to Mrs. Flynn the Barman to gather in details for the prosecution.<br><br>"Why was it all dark?" it demanded.<br><br>"The power went out," Mrs. Flynn the Barman said cheerfully.<br><br>"There's a fire." The child glowered around the room.<br><br>"These are loud men," it said, still annoyed, "and this one is dirty."<br><br>It indicated Gonzo, who winced. It considered Sally Culpepper.<br><br>"This lady has a flower on her...</p><h2>Thirteenth Child (1) (Frontier Magic)</h2><p>#1 NYT bestselling author Pat Wrede returns to Scholastic with an amazing new trilogy about the use of magic in the wild, wild west.<br><br>Eff was born a thirteenth child. Her twin brother, Lan, is the seventh son of a seventh son. This means he's supposed to possess amazing talent -- and she's supposed to bring only bad things to her family and her town. Undeterred, her family moves to the frontier, where her father will be a professor of magic at a school perilously close to the magical divide that separates settlers from the beasts of the wild.<br> With wit and wonder, Patricia Wrede creates an alternate history of westward expansion that will delight fans of both J. K. Rowling and Laura Ingalls Wilder.</p><p>Patricia C. Wrede is the universally acclaimed author of The Enchanted Forest Chronicles series, including Dealing with Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, and Talking to Dragons, as well as other novels, including Mairelon the Magician, The Magician&#39;s Ward, and, with Caroline Stevermer, Sorcery and Cecelia, The Grand Tour, and The Mislaid Magician. She lives in Minnesota.Grade 7&#x2013;9&#x2014;In this alternative history, a magical barrier protects most people from the dangerous magical creatures of the Wild West. Eff is a 13th unlucky child who supposedly will cause doom and misfortune, and is twin sister to Lan, the lucky and extra-magical 7th son of a 7th son. This novel covers a lot of ground both in time, following Eff from when she's 5 until she's 18, and in distance, as Eff's family moves to the Western frontier when Eff's magic-professor father and practical mother decide that the move will hide Eff and Lan's differences. Then Lan's potential is revealed after he causes an annoying classmate to float. When he leaves to go to school back East, Eff follows her own path to learning more about magic, including assisting in caring for the magical creatures at her father's college. Her narration provides background about life in this version of early America, where magic helps with daily chores but brings its own dangers. Eff's life in Lan's shadow will ring true to all siblings of a particularly talented child, but at the conclusion it's Eff who uses her own magic to rescue her twin. Reminiscent of Orson Scott Card's "Alvin Maker" books (Tor), this is an interesting, but often slow-moving tale.&#x2014;<i>Beth L.

His fascination with and respect for the pioneers who braved the wild frontier of the great American West inspire him to devote his full time to writing historical novels.<b>CHAPTER 1</b> <p> Young Jim Tracey loved to hunt. Maybe it was because he seemed to have a knack for it. Though only fourteen on this sunny day in the late spring of 1835, he had already proven himself as a marksman. From the age of ten, he had supplemented the family&#x2019;s dinner table with squirrels and rabbits most of them shot clean through the head with the rifle his daddy had given him. Because of his skill with the old flintlock, it was easy for Jim to persuade his father to let him take a mule up the mountain to see if he could sneak up on a deer.</p> <p> John Tracey was proud of his son&#x2019;s natural talent as a marksman. Although he took credit for teaching the youngster how to shoot, starting his instruction at an early age, still he knew that young Jim&#x2019;s ability was God-given. It was good for the boy to go off in the woods to hunt. They had been working long hours at the sluice box ever since the winter broke, with not a lot of gold dust to show for it. Besides, they could always use some fresh meat.</p> <p> John straightened up and, resting his shovel against a haystack-size boulder, arched his back in an effort to ease his aching muscles. He stood there a few moments, watching a young half-breed working with a shovel on the other side of the sluice. Henry Brown Bear was perhaps a year older than his own son, Jim. It was hard to say. John could only guess, and Henry wasn&#x2019;t even sure himself how old he was. He was a good worker, though, and John never regretted bringing him along. When he thought about it, John figured it was best for the boy as well. He had been hanging around the trading post on the Platte, and probably would have turned into another loafer Injun if he had remained there. He was also good company for Jim. The two of them would sit by the fire at night and see who could tell the biggest lies. It made John smile when he pictured his son. <i>I wish Julia could see how he&#x2019;s growing into a man</i>. The thought of his wife caused a sharp pang of melancholy to wrinkle his weary brow. <i>Maybe we won&#x2019;t stay another year, like I said before. We&#x2019;ve got a little dust not enough to buy a farm, but maybe we&#x2019;ll just take what we&#x2019;ve got and head back home</i>.</p> <p> Henry, let&#x2019;s call it a day. You&#x2019;ve been working pretty hard. Jim ain&#x2019;t the only one deserves a day off.&#x201d;</p> <p> Henry Brown Bear rested his shovel and straightened up. He gave John a wide, warm smile. John had never seen the half-breed boy in anything but a pleasant humor and he was always willing to work. John knew that Henry had to be tired, but the boy would have smiled just as warmly if he had told him they were going to work on through the night.</p> <p> In the next instant, Henry&#x2019;s smile seemed to freeze on his face and his eyes grew wide, staring right through John. He clenched his teeth hard, and he looked as if about to speak, but he made no sound. Instead, he pitched forward, falling facedown in the clear mountain stream. John watched, amazed, thinking at first that the young half-breed was again acting like a clown. He was about to laugh at the boy&#x2019;s antics when he saw the arrow shaft protruding from his back.</p> <p> Unable to move for a moment, frozen by the sight of a life just taken before him, John Tracey stared in disbelief. It took the snap of an arrow as the shaft splintered on the boulder beside him to shock his muscles into action. He broke from the stream and ran toward the cabin for his rifle. It was too late. He had barely reached the far bank when he felt the impact of the heavy rifle ball between his shoulder blades, driving him to the ground. At the same instant, the boom of the large-bore buffalo gun rolled over his head like a wave of summer thunder. He struggled to get to his feet, but his limbs seemed unwilling to support him. The pounding of his heart hammered in his ears as if that vital organ was going to crash through his rib cage. It was so loud that the sounds of fiendish war cries right behind him seemed way off in the distance, though he knew they were probably scalping poor Henry only a few yards away. John managed to gain his feet, but his chest felt heavy, like a huge stone had been lodged behind his breastbone. He staggered uncontrollably, struggling to escape the hands he could now feel grabbing and clutching at his clothes. It was the last sensation John Tracey felt in this world before a war axe was buried in his neck.</p> <p> On a low bluff some fifty yards away, overlooking the clear, rippling stream, a gruff-looking bear of a man stood. His buffalo gun in one hand, he watched the scene without emotion even with some amusement as his Blackfoot allies celebrated the kill. After a little while, he picked up his horse&#x2019;s reins and led it down to the scene of mutilation that was now under way. Once the scalps were taken, the bodies were left to rot as the savages busied themselves with ransacking the cabin. He himself had no interest in the spoils of the massacre. Only on second thought did he ask, Find any little sacks of yellow dust?&#x201d;</p> <p> Lame Fox, a solidly built warrior with a long scar across his back, answered, No.&#x201d; The big white man shrugged his shoulders, not really expecting any. Lame Fox spoke again. There is another man.&#x201d; He pointed to the edge of the clearing, where some tools were left near the back of the cabin. See, tracks say three men here.&#x201d;</p> <p> This interested the bearlike white man, but not enough to cause him concern. He had looked carefully at the two bodies a man and a boy. He was satisfied. It &#x2019;pears the other one went off up that way on a horse,&#x201d; he said. Lame Fox nodded agreement. Well, suit yourself on that one. We got the ones that matter.&#x201d;</p> <p> Always interested in acquiring another horse, Lame Fox called his warriors together. He sent four of them to trail the mule Jim had ridden up the mountain. He, along with the others, would return to their village in triumph with the big white man once they had finished here.</p> <p> * * *</p> <p> After having left his father and Henry, who were still shoveling gravel into the sluice box, Jim decided to hunt for bigger game than the deer he had set out for. He pushed on through the timberline, up above the trees to the high meadows in search of an elk. The thought of bringing back one of the majestic animals made him swell with imagined pride. He&#x2019;d show Henry what a mighty hunter he was. But after several hours of searching, he was disappointed to find no sign of elk, or anything else that would make meat for the camp. He decided to call it quits when he heard the powerful report of a large-bore rifle reverberating up through the canyons. <i>That wasn&#x2019;t Pa&#x2019;s rifle!</i></p> <p> What could it mean? There was only that one shot, but it sounded as if it had come from the valley below, maybe even from the cabin. He prodded the mule, pushing him down the mountain as quickly as he could in an effort to get back to the camp. The mule, having the better judgment of the two, resisted Jim&#x2019;s urging and would go no faster than he deemed prudent. Damn you,&#x201d; Jim admonished, can&#x2019;t you do no better than this?&#x201d; But the mule would not cooperate. So they made their way across the ridges and down into the forest belt at a steady but slow pace, with Jim flailing his arms and kicking the mule&#x2019;s rib cage. The mule simply ignored his antics.</p> <p> Once they descended the steep slope and were near the base of the firs, the mule relented and picked up the pace to a speed that was too fast to dodge and dart through the crowded pines safely, but Jim was anxious to close the remaining mile to the cabin. At that pace over the rough terrain, an accident was bound to happen. The mule saw the gulch that suddenly appeared before them and tried to swerve to the side, but it was too late. Jim went flying out of the saddle, landing on the near side of the gulch, rolling toward its lip when he hit the ground. He wound up in a tangled ball of juniper at the gully&#x2019;s bottom. The mule slid on his front legs before rolling down the side of another ridge, almost bowling over four startled Blackfoot warriors. One of them reacted quickly enough to grab the frightened animal&#x2019;s reins and bring it to a halt.</p> <p> Although young Jim was not aware of it yet, the spill had saved his life. Too stunned to move, he lay there wrapped in a cocoon of juniper and berry bushes. He was afraid to move for a few moments, unsure if he had broken any bones. In fact, it amazed him that he did not feel more than slight pain. Lying flat on his back, looking up at the sky from the bottom of the deep gulch, he decided it was time to test his limbs to make sure everything was still sound. Before he could move, however, he was frozen by the sound of voices above him. A moment later, he saw them pass along the rim of the gulch. <i>Injuns!</i> Their faces were painted for war, and they were already leading his mule away.</p> <p> His heart was pounding so rapidly, and so loud, that he feared they might hear it from above. All they had to do to discover him was to glance down into the gulch. He could do nothing but stare, unblinking, at the rim of the narrow gully as they slowly walked their horses past. There were four of them. The shot he had heard must have been fired by them. Maybe, he thought, they shot once at the cabin, and then his father and Henry scared them away. With nothing better to hope for, he decided that was it; his father had chased them away. Holding on to that slim hope, he waited, fearing to breathe, until the four disappeared over the ridge.</p> <p> He had been lucky. They had not thought to look down at him. However, he had lost his mule, along with his rifle.<i>But I got my hair</i>, he thought, and quickly tore his way out of the brambles, forgetting his earlier concern for broken bones. His foremost thought now was to get back to his father.</p> <p> Making his way as quickly as possible down the lower side of the steep slope above the stream, constantly scanning the terrain ahead of him, Jim was keenly aware of the deafening silence of the pines surrounding him. Every hundred yards or so he stopped to listen, straining to hear any sounds that might alert him to the presence of Indians, hoping that the four who had passed him back up the mountainside were all there were and not part of a larger war party. His heart was pumping hard, whether from the physical exertion of his haste, or from the thought of finding something dreadfully wrong at the cabin, he could not say.</p> <p> He struck the stream a hundred yards above the cabin. Cautious now, he slowed his pace and carefully made his way downstream, stepping from rock to rock, pausing often to listen and study the way before him. He smelled smoke too much smoke for a cookfire. He could feel his heartbeat pounding in his head now, and a cold feeling of dread sent shivers over his body. A few more paces down the stream, and he caught a glimpse of the cabin through the trees. The little bit he could see through the foliage showed nothing amiss. But, glancing up at the treetops, he saw a thin stream of smoky haze drifting overhead. Until then he had heard no sound above the noisy ripple of the stream. Now voices came to him on the wind and he froze in his tracks. It was Indian talk! Not loud screeching or war whoops, but just normal conversation between several Indians. Henry was half Crow. Maybe he was talking with them. That had to be it, for there was neither shooting nor shouting they were probably Indians looking for food or gifts. Still, he would be cautious.</p> <p> He left the stream and circled around in order to come up on their campsite from above, on the opposite side of the water. Crawling behind a huge boulder, he slowly raised his head until he could see the clearing and the cabin beyond. What he saw seared an image in his mind that would never completely fade from his memory. Below him, not fifty feet away, the body of the half-breed boy lay still in the shallow water. He knew it was Henry only by the clothes he wore, for his head had been smashed in with a large rock, and strips of flesh had been sliced from his arms and shoulders.</p> <p> Captivated by the horror before him, he was helpless to move. His eyes wide with fright, he looked beyond the corpse of his friend toward the group of twelve or more savages milling around the tiny clearing. Their horses were grazing on the grass behind the cabin, his father&#x2019;s horse and mules among them. A few of the Indians were making a halfhearted attempt to set fire to the cabin. The back room and a patch on the roof were burning, but the main cabin resisted their attempts. While Jim watched, horrified, they tired of the effort and rejoined their brothers. There was still no sign of his father. As he searched the clearing with his eyes, hoping that his father had managed to escape, he discovered his body.</p> <p> They had pulled his father&#x2019;s corpse over to a tree and left it in a sitting position, held up by more than a dozen arrows pinning his chest to the trunk. Jim almost cried out. He had to force himself to remain still. His father&#x2019;s scalp had been taken and his head and face were awash in blood. Like Henry, he was identifiable only by the clothes he wore, so brutal was the mutilation he had suffered at the hands of his murderers.</p> <p> Jim slid down behind the rock, too shocked by the sight to even cry. Dazed, he did not move for several minutes as his brain fought to right itself. After a while, he recovered his senses enough to realize that he could not remain there long without being discovered. He forced himself back up to take another look, totally at a loss as to what he should do. There was no thought of helping his father it was much too late for that. He wanted to run, but a strong feeling that he should at least take care of his father&#x2019;s body kept him at the boulder. Again, he eased his head above the top of the boulder until he could see the clearing. The actions of several of the warriors gave him cause for more immediate concern. They were scouting around the clearing, pointing at tracks and looking toward the stream. Jim had heard tales of the Indians&#x2019; ability to track enemies, and his spine went numb when he thought that maybe they were now setting out to find him. There was no more indecision on his part. He decided the best thing for him to do was to run as fast and as far as he could.</p> <p> * * *</p> <p> Buck Ransom made his way slowly and cautiously through the thick patch of willows that screened the creek bank below the beaver dam. His moccasined feet trod silently through the sparse brush that managed to compete with the willows for the earth&#x2019;s nourishment. Glancing about frequently, a matter of long habit in his chosen occupation, he still managed to focus his main attention on the sandy bank at the water&#x2019;s edge and on the bait stick that was still standing where he had set it. The float was missing. There was no sign of it in the water near the dam, where he would normally expect to find it if the critter had run with it. Gone too was the notch-stick, evidently pulled up and no doubt floating downstream somewhere.</p> <p> Kneeling on one knee, he remained absolutely still for a long time, listening and watching before leaving the cover of the willows. Buck was cautious by nature, but he was especially alert in Blackfoot country. The country around Pierre&#x2019;s Hole was smack-dab in the middle of Shoshone and Bannock territory, but Blackfoot war parties frequently raided in the area. And Blackfeet weren&#x2019;t too hospitable toward white trappers. Jim Bridger had counseled against Buck and his partner, Frank Brown, going to South Pass alone. There were beaver galore in the hundreds of streams that etched the Wind River and Sweetwater Mountains, he had said.

Three weeks later, an envelope arrives in the mail. A farmer named Pete has found his balloon! Gregory writes back, and the two become pen pals, exchanging mystery gifts with each letter. Finally, Pete sends a gift that Gregory can identify only by a trip to the antural history museum, and the object turns out to be something truly amazing. With illustrations by the author, The Silver Balloon is perfect for early chapter-book readers.<br></p><p>Susan Bonners is the author and illustrator of many fiction and nonfiction picture books for children, including The Wooden Doll, Just in Passing, and A Penguin Year. She lives in Roslindale, Massachusetts.Grade 2-4?A wonderful intergenerational story. Gregory, a shy fourth grader who lives in the city, initiates a pen-pal friendship when he sends off a message attached to a balloon. Clarence "Pete" Mayfield, a farmer, finds the balloon and responds with a letter and an unidentified gift. Gregory figures out what it is and writes a letter back to Pete, including a gift of his own?a bus token. As the correspondence continues, Gregory learns to overcome his fears and frustrations about communicating. He discovers that he has the ability to write, to talk on the phone, and even to take a trip across the city to ask a university professor about the final gift he receives, a canine from a saber-toothed cat. Readers are drawn into the story as they wonder about each mysterious item. Black-and-white pencil sketches appear throughout. An author's note states that helium-filled balloons are harmful to wildlife.

In FAIREST IN ALL THE LAND, the best names in comics take their turns fleshing out the pasts of the loveliest Fables in existence. For all those wanting to dive into FAIREST or FABLES, this original graphic novel is a fantastic entry point, as well as a great new chapter for those that have been following Bill Willingham's fairy tale epic for years.</p><p>BILL WILLINGHAM has been writing, and sometimes drawing, comics for more than twenty years.&nbsp; During that time he's had work published by nearly every comics publisher in the business and he's written many critically-acclaimed comic book series, including Elementals, FABLES, JACK OF FABLES, FAIREST, ROBIN, SHADOWPACT and SALVATION RUN.&nbsp; A multiple winner of the Eisner Award, Willingham has also been nominated for the International Horror Guild award.&nbsp; Bill lives somewhere near a good poker room.Omniscient powers of observation come in pretty handy when there&#x2019;s a serial murderer on the loose, but the Magic Mirror still needs a mobile body to do the bulk of the legwork, and that&#x2019;s where Cinderella&#x2014;a pretty good detective herself&#x2014;comes in. In this stand-alone graphic novel tied to Willingham&#x2019;s monthly comic Fairest, someone is murdering the fairest of them all, and Cinderella takes on the task of hunting down the killer and protecting the rest of the targets. As she traverses the Fables universe, encountering many faces familiar to fans of the long-running series, she&#x2019;s aided by the Magic Mirror and his storage-bound companions as they do their own investigation into the magical implements (and possible murder weapon) missing from the catacombs beneath their room. Each scene is illustrated by a different artist, showcasing a wide range of styles, from painterly portraits to panel-spanning action. Though familiarity with Fables and Fairest would come in handy, Willingham does a great job of telegraphing enough background that this volume can easily stand on its own. --Sarah Hunter</p><h2>The Vanishing Thieves (The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories Ser., No. 66)</h2><p>The Hardy boys accompany a Canadian teenager to Los Angeles to help locate a missing rare coin, but soon become involved in an even larger case.</p><p></p><h2>Wonder Woman Vol. 9: Resurrection</h2><p>She&#x2019;s the God of War, but Diana of Themyscira&#x2014;a.k.a.

In the course of their social rounds, Kitty meets Harry Dashwood - a younger cousin of the <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> Dashwoods - and the courtship begins. Mr. Darcy makes inquiries into Harry's character, fortune and expectations, but no sooner does he receive favorable answers than the suitor begins to behave most strangely. Harry gives a friend the "cut direct" outside Boodle's Club, and there are rumors of gambling and worse excesses. It's up to Darcy and Elizabeth to discover the cause of these aberrations, and, if at all possible, see Kitty happily established. The author smoothly combines characters from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> while remaining true to Austen's originals.

It might take a few leaps of history, but you'll find the answer in <i>The Knowledge Web</i>, another of science historian James Burke's compelling collections of circular narratives that have informed and inspired astute readers for years. Best known for his outstanding documentary series <i>Connections</i>, Burke has a genius for unraveling complex threads of history and sharing with us the remarkable coincidences and contingencies that built our modern world. In <i>The Knowledge Web</i> he shows us how the rapid flow of information engenders greater possibilities for the kinds of chance meetings that drive progress.<p> Burke uses a very neat trick that both demonstrates the potential of hypertext and makes a more pleasurable reading experience. When mentioning certain key figures or events, he includes a footnote that points the reader not to the bottom of the page or the end of the book, but to another point in the text where the figure or event comes into play again. Many other writers would find this impossible to pull off, but Burke's style is perfectly suited for these jumps; if anything, his major theme of interconnectedness is driven home in a fresh new way. Whether or not you're a fan of Burke's unique style, <i>The Knowledge Web</i> will delight and amaze you with its visions of the delicacy of history and the many paths the past must take to reach the future. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>James Burke's</b> books include the bestselling <i>Connections</i> and <i>The Day the Universe Changed.</i> He contributes a monthly column to <i>Scientific American</i> and serves as director, writer and host of the television series <i>Connections 3,</i> which airs on the Learning Channel.

His years in the palaces and halls of imperial government served him well when he set out to write this oftentimes eye-popping, tell-all account of the doings of the first 12 emperors, from Julius to Domitian, who make the good fellas of Mafia renown seem tame by comparison. From Suetonius we learn that Augustus was afraid of lightning and thunder and carried a piece of seal skin as protection against them; that Caligula slept with his mother and his sister; and that Nero outlawed mimes in Rome--which may mean that he wasn&#39;t such a bad man after all. Suetonius doesn&#39;t hesitate to say when he&#39;s reporting gossip that he has not personally verified, but what gossip it is!

Nothing is utopian. Everything wants to be. Soft Architects face the reaching middle.</em></p> <p>If architecture is the language of concrete and steel, then Soft Architecture needs a vocabulary of flesh, air, fabric and colour. It&#x2019;s about civic surface and natural history. It&#x2019;s about social space and clothing and urban geography and visual art, and some intersection of all these.</p> <p>This delectable book collects the rococo prose of Lisa Robertson, the ambulatory Office for Soft Architecture. There are essays on Vancouver fountains, the syntax of the suburban home, Value Village, the joy of synthetics, sca�olding and the persistence of the Himalayan blackberry. There are also seven Walks, tours of Vancouver sites &#x2013; poetic dioramas, really, and more material than cement could ever be.</p> <p><em>Soft Architecture</em> exists at the crossroads of poetry, theory, urban geography and cultural criticism, some place where the quotidian and the metaphysical marry and invert. The most intriguing book you&#x2019;ll encounter this year.</p> <p>&#x2018;We say, on almost every page and with utmost reverence, Holy shit. ... Ever since, we have wanted to think like Robertson, write like her, maybe even be her.&#x2019; &#x2013; <em>The Village Voice</em>, listing it as a top pick of 2004</p> <p>&#x2018;She plucks a subject (object) from the quotidian and banal in order to move through it, uncovering layers of the historical, the lyrical, and the political. The result feels somehow psychedelic.&#x2019; &#x2013; <em>The Stranger</em></p></p><p>Lisa Robertson is the author of <i>Debbie: An Epic</i>, <i>The Weather</i>, and <i>Occasional Work and Seven Walks from the Office for Soft Architecture</i>.The guide to the 13 works and seven "walks" of this little book (4 1/8"�5 7/8") is the "Office for Soft Architecture"-the alter ego of Canadian poet Robertson, author of <i>Debbie: An Epic</i> and <i>The Weather</i>. Seeking "the place in the polis of the sour heat and the pulse beneath our coats, the specific entry of our exhalations and words into the atmosphere," Robertson probes various fabrics, cities, rooms, people, histories and "the reaching middle," showing how life, in the way it uses space and time, is "soft architecture." Throughout, color and b&amp;w photos and illustrations provide visual context for site-specific prose perambulations: a set of postcards of Vancouver sights graffiti-ed with spouting water lead to "The Fountain Transcript" ("Corporate fountains drooling goofily. Public fools."); photos of temporary scalable structures interspersed with Elspeth Pratt's sculptures situate "Doubt and the History of Scaffolding"; a suite of his Paris bedrooms introduces a walk through "Atget's Interiors"; "The Value Village Lyric" wears what appears to be the Office's own thrift-store wardrobe: "We think of the casual bravado of Baudelaire's tied black cravat against the scrim of white collar in the photograph by Nadar." The book brings to mind Lytle Shaw's <i>Cable Factory 20</i> in its peculiar mix of weirdly enthusiastic investigative persona, cultural critique and historical sense, but develops a sensibility all its own, a "style of temporary hatred, nourished by each little loosened oyster we swallow, each acidic little kiss, each sweetmeat, each odour of saturation, each quirky, saline broth." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But Glyer's controversial nanites are more than just the latest technological advance, they are a new form of life&#x2015;and they have more uses than just medical. Glyer's nanites also have the potential to make everyone on Earth rich from the wealth of asteroids. <br>Twenty-five years ago, the Briareus mission took nanomachinery out to divert an Earth-crossing asteroid and bring it back to be mined, only to drop out of contact as soon as it reached its target. The project was shut down and the technology was forcibly suppressed. <br>Now, a much, much larger asteroid is on a collision course with Earth&#x2015;and the Briareus nanites may be responsible. While the government scrambles to find a solution, Glyer knows that their only hope of avoiding Armageddon lies in the nanites themselves. On the run, Glyer must track down his old partner, William Connors, and find a way to make contact with their wayward children. <br>As every parent learns, when you produce a new thinking being, the plans it makes are not necessarily your plans. But with a two-hundred-gigaton asteroid that rivals the rock that felled the dinosaurs hurtling toward Earth, Glyer and Connors don't have time to argue.

However, the basic principles were valuable, as in the case of using Mars to dump some excess velocity. Too much, as it turned out; there was atmospheric friction as the rock skimmed the planet. There was plenty of warning, and no entities were killed, but it put the rock into a trajectory that wouldn&#x2019;t provide an opportunity to match up with Earth&#x2019;s position for several orbits. <br>There was no hurry. <br>And there was interesting material coming in by radio all the time. <br>Nobody doubted the concept of fiction any longer. Now the issue was what was fiction and what wasn&#x2019;t. <br>Information was sorted into subsets of material that was internally consistent. A great many of the small subsets were clearly fiction. Some of the larger ones were deduced to be, after it was noted that they were incomplete but claimed all information not included in them was false. There was a large main body of material consistent with all but a few subsets, but these latter were excluded from serious consideration as soon as any content was found that contradicted observations the entities were able to make themselves. <br>A considerable mass of information was internally consistent, but significant portions of it were explanations of why it could not be substantiated by any observations. These seemed to be disseminated for the sole purpose of supporting warnings against things that could not be found to exist, and required elaborate suppositions to account for such matters as, e.g., the visibility of distant objects which would have to be older than the Universe. The only thing that kept the entities from dismissing it was the fact that its assorted positions were endorsed by the vast majority of transmission sources. <br>It was Set who suggested that humans were doing the same thing that he and Wieland and Socrates had once done: disputing over which plan they should undertake. To this end, the faction currently in charge had convinced itself that any evidence to the contrary was some form of deception. <br>This notion would have been regarded by the other entities as deeply flawed&#x2014;and probably would never have been imagined, by Set or anyone else&#x2014;if not for the fact that all the material that had not been excluded, regardless of what its subsets disagreed about, was linked, if followed far enough, to the concept of deliberate fission explosions. <br>Supposedly there were thousands of fission&#x2014;and fusion&#x2014;devices, all over Earth, held in readiness to throw at, for the most part, other such devices. The purpose of this was to inflict enough death on other humans to persuade the survivors to follow the plan of the people who had taken the least damage, while preventing other factions from inflicting as much by destroying their bombs. <br>The peculiar thing was, just about everyone who had those devices was participating in some form of the deception system. They were already in charge. <br>And one of the things that they had made themselves believe would surely kill them all was, essentially, the entities.

As the child of a naval family, his fascination with the Mediterranean world started early, on the island of Malta. He has lived in Istanbul, walked across much of western Turkey, and traveled widely throughout the region. His particular interests are the Byzantine, Venetian, and Ottoman empires, seafaring, and eyewitness history. He is the author of three books on the empires of the Mediterranean and its surroundings: <i>1453: The Holy War for Constantinople</i>, <i>Empires of the Sea</i>, and <i>City of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Waves</i>.<br><br>On May 29, 1453, Ottoman forces, under the leadership of Mehmet II, concluded their long and bloody siege of Constantinople by storming the city and overtaking it. According to Crowley, who works in publishing in England;the Ottoman conquest of the city brought to an end centuries of conflict between the Byzantine Empire and Islam. In overwhelming detail and colorless prose, Crowley chronicles the story of an ancient city and its attraction to members of two major religions. Before Mehmet's conquest, Constantinople had faced various unsuccessful sieges, and Crowley faithfully records them. The most destructive events came between 1341 and 1371, when earthquakes and the Black Death devastated the city, turning it into a forlorn series of villages. Although the Byzantine capital recovered enough of its former glory to entice Mehmet to its walls, even he felt tremendous disappointment, finding the city didn't live up to its reputation. Crowley drones through the day-by-day events of Mehmet's siege and the results of the conquest. Perhaps the author's most instructive point, made by others as well, is that Mehmet turned the city into one where religious toleration and multiculturalism flourished. <i>(Aug. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ellis grew up in the poor white section of Durham, North Carolina, and as a young man joined the Ku Klux Klan. Ann Atwater, a single mother from the poor black part of town, quit her job as a household domestic to join the civil rights fight. During the 1960s, as the country struggled with the explosive issue of race, Atwater and Ellis met on opposite sides of the public school integration issue. Their encounters were charged with hatred and suspicion. In an amazing set of transformations, however, each of them came to see how the other had been exploited by the South's rigid power structure, and they forged a friendship that flourished against a backdrop of unrelenting bigotry.<br><br>Rich with details about the rhythms of daily life in the mid-twentieth-century South, <i>The Best of Enemies</i> offers a vivid portrait of a relationship that defied all odds. By placing this very personal story into broader context, Osha Gray Davidson demonstrates that race is intimately tied to issues of class, and that cooperation is possible--even in the most divisive situations--when people begin to listen to one another.<br><br></p><p>"For eighty years we've waited for a reply to <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. At last Osha Gray Davidson has done the job. The story of C. P. Ellis, Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan of Durham, North Carolina, and of Ann Atwater, a black civil rights advocate, his enemy for so many years, is one of the most moving love stories I've ever come across. More than that, in a time of bleakness, it sounds a note of hope. <i>The Best of Enemies</i> is a glorious work."--Studs Terkel <br>Claiborne Paul Ellis, known to all as &#34;C.P.&#34;, grew up in the &#34;poor white&#34; section of Durham, North Carolina, just north of the railroad tracks that marked the boundary between the white and black neighborhoods. Surrounded by poverty and affected early by a pervasive racism, C.P. devoured the tales his father told him of the secret, all-white society that would save Dixie, and as a young man he joined the Ku Klux Klan. In 1955, Ann Atwater was employed as a domestic servant when the ripples from the Montgomery bus boycotts hit Durham. Incensed by a racist remark made by her employer, Ann quit her job to join the civil rights fight. During the 1960s, as the country struggled with the explosive issues of race and class, Ann met C.P. on opposite sides of the public school integration issue. Their encounters were charged with hatred and suspicion. Gradually, though, Ann and C.P. each came to see how the other had been exploited by the South&#39;s rigid power structure, and they forged a friendship that even today flourishes against a background of renewed bigotry. In our racially divisive times, Osha Gray Davidson gives us a vivid portrait of a friendship that defied all odds. And with characteristic skill and elan he probes one of the most crucial concerns at the heart of our culture: how and why race is a potentially destructive force. The Best of Enemies weaves rich history with an inspiring personal saga to depict the triumph of the human spirit over the tragic past.</p><h2>VERSO SEXLTY FLD VISION</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

The way he tries to put a good face on his disastrous efforts is still funny after more than 30 books.

Like Marston's nonfiction title <i>Women in the Middle East: Tradition and Change</i> (Scholastic, 1996), these stories dispel many stereotypes about this part of the world.

The characters are complex and interesting, and the Middle Eastern settings are described in rich detail. Each selection is followed by a note in which the author explains social issues specific to the story that may be unfamiliar to readers.

He&#x2019;s also been fascinated by the recordists who came before him, themselves pioneers in the sound-capturing field, and the extraordinary technological developments that have made their work possible.</p> <p><i>Songcatchers</i> looks at our universal appreciation of music and the reasons why, over the past century, technology and curiosity have carried the shamanic chants of Siberia, the dying folk music of isolated European villages, and the ecstatic gamelan sounds of Bali to music lovers all over the world.</p> <p>The personal tales of the songcatchers are full of romance, derring-do, and intrigue: some of them were scholars, others adventurists, and a few full-fledged spies. The machines that made their work possible progressed from the early treadle-powered phonographs that allowed sound waves to imprint wax cylinders to magnetic tape that captured sound in iron oxide particles to the digital domain of today.</p> <p>Hart ventures across time and continents in following the songcatchers and their machines, and throughout it all he celebrates music and its ability to transcend the mundane and transport the human spirit.</p></p><p>For some time now, Grateful Dead drummer Hart has been a songcatcher, a collector of the originally noncommercial music popularly called traditional music. Many anthropologists, musicians, political and labor organizers, composers, social workers, and others were songcatchers before him, and it is their collective story that he and professional writer Kostyal tell in this engaging book. They discourse a little on music's many purposes, then leap into songcatching via sound recording. The first field recordings were of American Indian music, and the late-nineteenth-century phenomenon of world's fairs spurred the capture of Asian, African, and Pacific Island music. Meanwhile, young Anglophone composers combed the British Isles for their peoples' songs. Hart and Kostyal note major figures and events in field recording down to the present, at which point Hart relates his own experiences. Historic photographs magnificently illustrate Hart and Kostyal's accessible overview of a subject that, despite its intrinsic attractiveness, has usually been written up only in turgid academic tomes. A book for every popular library. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sir Horatio Hornblower has received strict and highly confidential orders from the highest rank: he must embark upon a grave and perilous mission to recapture the Flame in the Bay of Seine, where the brutal and foul-tempered Lieutenant Augustine Chadwick is being held prisoner by a mutinous crew. Rescuing the Lieutenant demands all of Horatio&#39;s spirit and seafaring prowess - for at the same time, he must contend with capturing two French cargo vessels and take part in negotiations to topple the faltering Napoleon once and for all . . . This is the ninth of eleven books chronicling the adventures of C. S. Forester&#39;s inimitable nautical hero, Horatio Hornblower.</p><p>C. S. Forester was born in Cairo in 1899, where his father was stationed as a government official. He studied medicine at Guy&#39;s Hospital, and after leaving Guy&#39;s without a degree he turned to writing as a career. On the outbreak of war he entered the Ministry of Information and later he sailed with the Royal Navy to collect material for The Ship. He made a voyage to the Bering Sea to gather material for a similar book on the United States Navy, and it was during this trip that he was stricken with arteriosclerosis, a disease which left him crippled. However, he continued to write and in the Hornblower novels created the most renowned sailor in contemporary fiction. He died in 1966.As this novel of the final days of the Napoleonic War begins, Horatio Hornblower has been ordered to quell a mutiny that he is afraid may have been justified. The story continues as he wins a major naval victory, a peerage, and the death penalty at a French prison camp. Christian Rodska conveys the drama of these events with his compelling and engaging reading. Rodska is a familiar name in the audiobook field due to his precise, expressive voice and his talent with character and accents, all demonstrated on this program.

"A masterpiece...quintessential Chesterton, with sparkling surface masking frequent emotional depths...amusing, full of surprises, supremely readable." &#x2014; <i>Saturday Review.</i><br></p><p>GK Chesterton was born in London in 1874 and educated at St Paul&#x2019;s School, before studying art at the Slade School. In 1896, he began working for the London publisher, Redway, and also T. Fisher Unwin as a reader where he remained until 1902. During this time he undertook his first freelance journalistic assignments, writing art and literary reviews. He also contributed regular columns to two newspapers: &#x2018;The Speaker&#x2019; (along with his friend Hilaire Belloc) and the &#x2018;Daily News&#x2019;. Throughout his life he contributed further articles to journals, particularly &#x2018;The Bookman&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Illustrated London News&#x2019;. His first two books, poetry collections, were published in 1900. These were followed by collections of essays and in 1903, and his most substantial work to that point, a study of &#x2018;Robert Browning&#x2019;. Chesterton's first novel, 'The Napoleon of Notting Hill' was published in 1904. In this book he developed his political attitudes in which he attacked socialism, big business and technology and showed how they become the enemies of freedom and justice. These were themes which were to run throughout his other works. 'The Man who was Thursday' was published in 1908 and is perhaps the novel most difficult to understand, although it is also his most popular. 'The Ball and the Cross' followed in 1910 and 'Manalive' in 1912. Chesterton's best-known fictional character appears in the Father Brown stories, the first of the collection, 'The Innocence of Father Brown', being published in 1911. Brown is a modest Catholic priest who uses careful psychology to put himself in the place of the criminal in order to solve the crime. His output was prolific, with a great variety of books from brilliant studies of &#x2018;Dickens&#x2019;, &#x2018;Shaw&#x2019;, and &#x2018;RL Stevenson&#x2019; to literary criticism. He also produced more poetry and many volumes of political, social and religious essays. Tremendous zest and energy, with a mastery of paradox, puns, a robust humour and forthright devotion along with great intelligence characterise his entire output. In the years prior to 1914 his fame was at its height, being something of a celebrity and seen as a latter day Dr Johnson as he frequented the pubs and offices of Fleet Street. His huge figure was encased in a cloak and wide brimmed hat, with pockets full of papers and proofs. Chesterton came from a nominally Anglican family and had been baptized into the Church of England. However, at that point he had no particular Christian belief and was in fact agnostic for a time. Nevertheless, in his late twenties he began to explore the possibility of a religious belief for himself, which he then discovered already existed as orthodox Christianity. In 1896, he had also met Frances Alice Blogg, marrying in 1901. She was a devout Anglican and her beliefs strengthened his Christian convictions. In 1922 he converted to Catholicism and he explores his belief in many works, the best known of which is 'Orthodoxy', his personal spiritual odyssey. In some ways, 'Orthodoxy' was an answer to earlier criticisms received after the 1905 publication of 'Heretics', which was a collection of studies of the then contemporary writers. The complaint was made that Chesterton discussed these writers&#x2019; attitudes to life, but offered nothing in respect of himself. He was an ebullient character, absent-minded, but quick-witted and will be remembered as one of the most colourful and provocative writers of his day. G.K. Chesterton died in 1936.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Fluid Film Lubrication (McGraw-Hill Mechanical Engineering)</h2><p>This book focuses specifically on fluid film lubrication rather than on the general topic of tribology.

In this northernmost valley, the only existing modern building is the tiny pit toilet at the Eureka Dunes. The trade-off for all this remoteness is the lofty and pristine Eureka Sand Dunes; the alien dry lake bed of The Racetrack,&#x201d; where rocks move and leave tracks; the shining and desolate views of the Saline Valley from Ubehebe Peak, the highest peak in the Last Chance Range; and the copper mining camps, forgotten and few.<br><ul><br><li><b>Scotty&#x2019;s Castle:</b> This Spanish colonial-style mansion lies in the rocky twists of the Grapevine Mountains.

I spent my days riding my bicycle around town, even though sometimes it was so hot the metal on my handlebars felt like a stove top. I could always taste the dust in my mouth&#x2014;gritty and weedy like the rabbit brush and cacti that battled the desert sun and heat to survive. My family had little money, and I was often hungry. I didn&#x2019;t like being hungry. I didn&#x2019;t like being poor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lancaster&#x2019;s greatest claim to fame was Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier at nearby Edwards Air Force Base some twenty years earlier. All day long planes would fly overhead, training pilots and testing aircraft. I wondered what it would be like to be Chuck Yeager flying the Bell X-1 at Mach 1, accomplishing what no human had ever done before. How small and desolate Lancaster must have looked to him from forty five thousand feet up going faster than anyone ever thought possible. It seemed small and desolate to me, and my feet were only a foot above the ground as I pedaled around on my bike.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had noticed my thumb missing that morning. I kept a wooden box under my bed that had all my most prized possessions. A small notebook that held my doodles, some secret poetry, and random crazy facts I had learned&#x2014;like twenty banks are robbed every day in the world, snails can sleep for three years, and it&#x2019;s illegal to give a monkey a cigarette in Indiana. The box also held a worn copy of Dale Carnegie&#x2019;s <i>How</i> <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, dog-eared on the pages that listed the six ways to get people to like you. I could recite the six things from memory.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Become genuinely interested in other people.<br> 2. Smile.<br> 3. Remember that a person&#x2019;s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.<br> 4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.<br> 5. Talk in terms of the other person&#x2019;s interest.<br> 6. Make the other person feel important&#x2014;and do it sincerely.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to do all of these things when I talked to anyone, but I always smiled with my mouth closed because when I was younger I had fallen and hit my upper lip on our coffee table, knocking out my front baby tooth. Because of that fall my front tooth grew in crooked and was discolored a dark brown. My parents didn&#x2019;t have the money to get it fixed. I was embarrassed to smile and show my discolored crooked tooth, so I tried to keep my mouth closed at all times.<br> &nbsp;<br> Besides the book, my wooden box also had all my magic tricks&#x2014;a pack of marked cards, some gimmicked coins that I could change from nickels into dimes, and my most prized possession: a plastic thumb tip that could hide a silk scarf or a cigarette. That book and my magic tricks were very important to me&#x2014;gifts from my father. I had spent hours and hours practicing with that thumb tip. Learning how to hold my hands so it wouldn&#x2019;t be obvious and how to smoothly stuff the scarf or a cigarette inside it so that it would appear to magically disappear. I was able to fool my friends and our neighbors in the apartment complex. But today the thumb was missing.<br> Gone. Vanished. And I wasn&#x2019;t too happy about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> My brother, as usual, wasn&#x2019;t home, but I figured maybe he had taken it or at least might know where it was. I didn&#x2019;t know where he went every day, but I decided to get on my bike and go looking for him. That thumb tip was my most prized possession. Without it I was nothing. I needed my thumb back.</p><h2>John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums</h2><p>(Book).

Although Bonham had to be courted away from more lucrative offers, he joined the newly formed band in 1968, helping guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant create such famous songs as &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; and &#34;Kashmir&#34; until his sudden death in 1980 at the age of 32. His unmistakable drum patterns are among the most emulated and sampled by today&#39;s rock drummers.

Gossip columns claimed Charles paid more attention to his gardens than his wife. <i>The Garden at Highgrove</i> takes readers on a tour of Charles's favorite creation--a maze-like garden surrounding the estate where he has primarily lived for the past 20 years. Various styles thrive within the boundaries of the property: wildflower meadows, formal hedgerows, outdoor rooms, carefully plotted tapestries of Queen of Night tulips. If Diana complained of neglect, Highgrove's landscape looks like it has been lavishly doted on. In one series of photos, we see the transformation of a large plot, viewed from the house, as it has been completely erased and re-created year to year. Who has time to complete and then entirely redo a garden on a regular basis? A prince, of course. Although the landscape glows with a vibrant, almost artificial green, Charles has long been a committed organic gardener. In the introduction he recalls the period when he came around to the cause of environmentalism. While driving through a declining English countryside in the 1960s and 1970s, "I remember longing to heal the countryside, to bind up its wounds and to reclothe it in its rightful form." <i>The Garden at Highgrove</i> will inspire gardeners, even those who don't live in palaces, who are looking for images of elegance and can't afford a staff to keep the hedges perfect. <i>--Emily White</i></p><h2>My Utmost for His Highest: Value Edition</h2><p>Where can readers turn to deepen their love and understanding of God?

This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s available in a beautiful, bonded leather gift edition especially for women.

S. Pritchett. "One thinks of it lying in Samuel Butler's desk for thirty years, waiting to blow up the Victorian family and with it the whole great pillared and balustraded edifice of the Victorian novel."<br> Written between 1873 and 1884 but not published until 1903, a year after Butler's death, his marvelously uninhibited satire savages Victorian bourgeois values as personified by multiple generations of the Pontifex family. A thinly veiled account of his own upbringing in the bosom of a God-fearing Christian family, Butler's scathingly funny depiction of the self-righteous hypocrisy underlying nineteenth-century domestic life was hailed by George Bernard Shaw as "one of the summits of human achievement."<br> "If the house caught on fire, the Victorian novel I would rescue from the flames would be The Way of All Flesh," wrote William Maxwell in The New Yorker. "It is read, I believe, mostly by the young, bent on making out a case against their elders, but Butler was fifty when he stopped working on it, and no reader much under that age is likely to appreciate the full beauty of its horrors. . . . Every contemporary novelist with a developed sense of irony is probably in some measure, directly or indirectly, indebted to Butler, who had the misfortune to be a twentieth-century man born in the year 1835."</p><h2>Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography</h2><p>This definitive biography is based on five years of interviews with de Beauvoir, and is written with her full cooperation. Bair penetrates the mystique of this brilliant and often paradoxical woman, who has been called one of the great minds of the 20th century, and surely, one of the most famously unconventional figures of her generation. &#34;As a reference work . . . Simone de Beauvoir can be considered definitive&#34;.--The Atlantic. 16-page photographic insert.</p><p>Deirdre Bair was a literary journalist before taking an MA and PhD at Colombia University. Since then, she has been a university professor and has lectured and written extensively on contemporary British and French literature.Bair, author of Samuel Beckett (a 1979 National Book Award winner), met with de Beauvoir for six years to compile this detailed biography of the writer best known for The Second Sex . She includes generous details about de Beauvoir's less attractive personal attributes (her slovenliness and self-centered behavior) and her questionable record during World War II. The book is an objective recording of events that shaped the life of a woman who, willingly, played down her own significant contributions to contemporary philosophical and political thought so as to remain Sartre's intellectual alter ego. Generous annotations document every chapter and provide material suggesting further research. An interesting, thought-provoking work that should dispel many myths, but Bair might well have given us a greater feel for the woman and emphasized her feminist stance.<br><i>- Danielle Mihram, Univ. of Southern California Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Small Step? : The Great Moon Hoax and the Race to Dominate Earth from Space</h2><p>Is it possible that the famous American moon landings were nothing but an illusion&#x2015;all a fabrication? Could NASA have fooled the world by broadcasting simulations that had been filmed for training purposes? <br><br> From the very first manned flight into orbit right up to the present day, there have been serious anomalies in the official narrative of the conquest of space. Bestselling author Gerhard Wisnewski dissects the history in minute detail&#x2015;from the first Russian missions to the final American moon project of Apollo 17&#x2015;looking at films, photos, radio communications, personal statements, and other available material. Using forensic methods of investigation, he pieces together a complex jigsaw depicting a disturbing picture of falsifications, lies, and fakery in the Cold War struggle for supremacy between the Soviet Union and the United States. The evidence he presents casts serious doubt on the possibility of humans ever having walked on the moon. <br><br> Wisnewski&#x2019;s research calls for a reassessment of the received wisdom that has become a part of our cultural fabric. He insists that the true story of space exploration has a more sinister undertone. Beneath the guise of civilian space travel, the US military has been developing fearsome new equipment and weapons to be secretly stationed in space, whose purpose is to militarize the sphere surrounding the Earth, and whose potential targets are every human being on the planet. <br><br> Profusely illustrated with more than 200 photos and diagrams.</p><p><b>Gerhard Wisnewski,</b> born in 1959, studied political science.

But he was also the creator of some astonishingly imaginative, outrageous, and wonderfully disgusting verses. From oozing grobes to slimy slugs, this extraordinary collection is bursting with Dahl&#x2019;s poems, verses, and songs. And with full-color original illustrations from a distinguished group of more than twenty artists, including Quentin Blake,William Joyce, and Lane Smith, this lavish volume is a must-have for any Dahl fan&#x2019;s library.</p></p><p><b>Roald Dahl</b>&nbsp;(1916-1990) was born in Wales of Norwegian parents. He spent his childhood in England and, at age eighteen, went to work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa. When World War II broke out, he joined the Royal Air Force and became a fighter pilot. At the age of twenty-six he moved to Washington, D.C., and it was there he began to write. His first short story, which recounted his adventures in the war, was bought by&nbsp;<i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, and so began a long and illustrious career.<br> <br> After establishing himself as a writer for adults, Roald Dahl began writing children&#x2019;s stories in 1960 while living in England with his family. His first stories were written as entertainment for his own children, to whom many of his books are dedicated.<br> <br> Roald Dahl is now considered one of the most beloved storytellers of our time. Although he passed away in 1990, his popularity continues to increase as his fantastic novels, including&nbsp;<i>James and the Giant Peach</i>,&nbsp;<i>Matilda</i>,&nbsp;<i>The BFG</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, delight an ever-growing legion of fans.<br> <br> Learn more about Roald Dahl on the official Roald Dahl Web site:&nbsp;<b>www.roalddahl.com</b>Starred Review. Grade 2-6&#x2013;Dahl wrote many delightful poems, some of which are hidden in his splendid novels. This dynamic collection includes The Centipede's Song from <i>James and the Giant Peach</i> and Willy Wonka's Wonka-Vite from <i>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</i>. The verses are illustrated by an assortment of talented artists, including Chris Wormell, Chris Riddell, Babette Cole, and Tony Ross. Quentin Blake's signature line drawings introduce each thematic section. Playful lines like Veruca Salt, the little brute,/Has just gone down the rubbish chute (Concerning Veruca Salt) and We may see a Creature with forty-nine heads/Who lives in the desolate snow,/And whenever he catches a cold (which he dreads)/He has forty-nine noses to blow (There's No Knowing What We Shall See) are irresistible. Unfortunately, no biographical information is provided for the illustrators. An index lists the titles of the poems under their sources along with their page numbers but no index of first lines is included. This vivacious addition to poetry collections will amuse a broad audience.<i>&#x2013;Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The landscapes are as sunny and verdant as a view across lost Arcady.</p> <p>The people of Fluter share the attributes of their wonderful world. They seem to dance through life to the measures of music they alone can hear: women of many talents, noble philosophers, solitary vagabonds wandering the lonely places. In general the folk of Fluter are friendly and gay, and anxious to appear beautiful in the eyes of the off-worlders, whom they revere perhaps unreasonably. In the main they are addicted to the joys of feasting, music, star-naming, sailing the wild seas, and love-making in a style known as &#x2018;ingesting the perfumed flowers&#x2019;.</p> <p><i>NOTE: The intelligent reader will quickly observe that the article quoted above is a masterpiece of hyperbole; doubtless the writer was never any closer to Fluter than his local amusement park. Only the most naive of readers, upon exposure to the article, will set off pell-mell for Fluter hoping to find &#x2018;ineffable glamour and daily episodes of erotic hi-jinks&#x2019;.</i></p> <p><i>The following facts should be noted. The scenery of Fluter is very pleasant. The best hotel in Coro-Coro is the O-Shar-Shan, but there is no running hot water. The girls are neither seductive nor particularly amiable. Arrivals at the spaceport are allowed visitor&#x2019;s permits of thirty days duration.</i></p> <p>1</p> <p>The geography of Fluter as seen from space was extraordinary, and perhaps unique &#x2014; certainly within the bounds of the Gaean Reach. In cooling from its primal melt the world had shrunk, squeezing up the crust into nine enormous anticlines running north and south across all of one hemisphere, leaving the opposite hemisphere a flat peneplain. In the course of time the sea rose and the rock-folds became nine narrow continents, with shallow seas between. The opposite hemisphere was drowned beneath the waters of a vast featureless ocean.</p> <p>Time passed. The climate was benign; life came to Fluter, and clothed the land in verdure of innumerable varieties. A band of Gaean pioneers arrived from the world Ergard, to settle all nine continents. Five years later, at the First Conclave, they bound themselves to a set of strict covenants by which to control their population, so that never should Fluter become the congested jungle of concrete towers, underground warrens, smells, stinks and pollution, crowded streets and cramped space which they had left behind on Ergard. Time might pass &#x2014; a hundred years, a thousand years &#x2014; but never, so they swore, would they allow their wonderful new world to be so desecrated. The Flauts, as they called themselves, surveyed the nine continents and divided the arable land into sections, with each section rated for a maximum population which might never be exceeded.</p> <p>A thousand years later, the population of Fluter occupied one hundred and forty-seven villages scattered at random across all nine continents, along with a special node surrounding the Coro-Coro spaceport.</p> <p>The native flora co-existed amiably with dozens of exotic imports, from Old Earth and elsewhere. The ubiquitous coconut palm leaned across a thousand beaches; exotic hardwoods, softwoods, flowering shrubs and vines grew in the Fluter forests and along the mountain slopes. The fauna consisted of a few lizards and insects on land, and a variety of marine life, which made the waters fascinating but dangerous.</p> <p>At Coro-Coro, on Continent Five, was the famous O-Shar-Shan Hotel, and a dozen other tourist hotels more or less fashionable. Though the calculations were often complicated, Coro-Coro was subject to the same population controls as the rest of Fluter, so that Coro-Coro remained an oversized village.</p> <p>2</p> <p>The <i>Glicca</i> landed at the Coro-Coro spaceport and was boarded by a team of local officials. Their routines were unusually careful. A pair of medics tested ship, crew and passengers for noxious diseases, while another technician filtered samples of air in search of undesirable viruses, pollen, spores or proteins. Finding nothing of interest, the team departed the ship. Meanwhile, an immigration officer noted name, age, world of origin, reason for visit, criminal record, if any, for each member of the ship&#x2019;s complement, issuing entry permits as he did so. He then addressed the company.</p> <p>&#x201c;Please listen with care! I am Civil Agent Uther Taun; I represent the administration of Coro-Coro and, effectually, of all Fluter. Civil Agents are charged with many responsibilities, but most importantly we guard the beauty of our beloved world. Severe penalties are visited upon anyone so depraved as to distribute litter or cause any other defilement. I need not enlarge upon these laws, except to state that they are enforced with diligence by a corps of special Civil Agents, and equally vigilant Land Agents. If appropriate, penalties of three orders are inflicted. Neither the Land Agents nor the Civil Agents accept excuses! Wastes must be deposited in certified receptacles. Random micturition or defecation at large are never encouraged, for reasons which need not be particularized. Nevertheless, rather than frowning and wincing, you should think yourselves privileged to enjoy the delights of Fluter! Visitor&#x2019;s permits are valid for thirty days, but may be renewed upon timely application. I will mention for persons desiring temporary employment, a Labor Exchange is situated nearby, along Pomare Boulevard.</p> <p>&#x201c;A final word: if, during your excursion, you should come upon a village, you would be prudent to turn away and go elsewhere. Should you ignore my advice and enter the village, be absolutely discreet! The typical Flaut is not a graceful host; to the contrary he is both unfeeling and surly. If you visit a village tavern, use total decorum. If you encounter a female, no matter of what age, abstain from familiarity, since the Flauts have no qualms about thrashing an obnoxious tourist. If you are careful and pay with a willing hand, you will encounter no trouble.</p> <p>&#x201c;Another matter of importance: the lands of Fluter are devoid of both dangerous beasts and predatory birds; the law therefore forbids the importation or possession of power guns, or other such weapons. This is an ancient law, enacted during the Terrible Times. It was felt that warriors of the day committed enough horror with their dirks and battle-hatchets without the need for more help. The law is still enforced by the Civil Agents, and applies to all weapons of projective energy, large or small. No excuses pertain, and penalties are of the third order. Now then: are there questions?&#x201d;</p> <p>The ineffable Cooner stepped forward, his plump face alight with eager innocence. He raised his hand on high, fingers fluttering. The Civil Agent looked down at him. &#x201c;You have a question?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes sir! Why are there both Civil Agents and Land Agents?&#x201d;</p> <p>The Agent frowned coldly. &#x201c;The differences are real, but sometimes unclear to the public. In general, the Civil Agents patrol Coro-Coro, while the Land Agents keep a vigilant surveillance over the conduct of campers and excursionists.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And which is the more severe?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Neither is severe. Both enforce the law of the land to the exact jot and tittle.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; cried Cooner, with unbecoming joviality. &#x201c;And what, may I ask, is the nature of the three orders of punishment? What, exactly, do they designate?&#x201d;</p> <p>The Agent, not happy with Cooner&#x2019;s flippant demeanor, answered tersely: &#x201c;These matters are considered indelicate; ladies and gentlemen prefer to ignore them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; cried Cooner, chuckling. &#x201c;You misread your audience! Aboard the <i>Glicca</i> we are all philosophers; not a lady or a gentleman in the group! You may speak on with an easy mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Agent&#x2019;s voice became even more terse than before. &#x201c;Just as you like. Listen then!</p> <p>&#x201c;Punishment of the first order is public chastisement. Punishment of the second order includes disgrace, confiscation of all property and expulsion from Fluter dressed only in a bramble. Punishment of the third order involves death by subaqueation in Sharler&#x2019;s Pond.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hm,&#x201d; said Cooner, more soberly than before. &#x201c;I see that you take your litigation seriously. Perhaps it is wise to stay within the law.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That is ever the case,&#x201d; said the official.</p> <p>&#x201c;A final question!&#x201d; called Cooner. &#x201c;How might I detect a Civil Agent or a Land Agent, when one is in the vicinity? How are they different?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The questions are nuncupatory. The most prudent conduct is to assume that you are being watched by one or the other at all times. To answer your question more circumspectly: the Civil Agent is never conspicuous, even though he wears a neat uniform. He is polite even when he is taking you into custody. Tradition ordains that he wear a short square beard. He is mature but never infirm, and is notable for his punctilio. The Land Agent wears a green sash and carries a ceremonial whangee. Otherwise he is much like a Civil Agent. Now: to other business.&#x201d; From his pouch he brought forth pamphlets entitled: &#x2018;LEGAL CODE, Ordinary Regulations&#x2019;, &#x2018;Duties of the Visitor&#x2019; and &#x2018;Advice from a Civil Agent&#x2019;.</p> <p>&#x201c;Everyone must study this compendium with care!&#x201d; declared the Agent. &#x201c;There can then be no excuses for misconduct!&#x201d;</p> <p>Cooner muttered: &#x201c;Never fear; we shall creep about our affairs on tiptoe.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Agent pretended not to hear. He distributed the pamphlets, then departed the ship.</p> <p>3</p> <p>Perrumpter Kalash made a final attempt to soften the resolve of Captain Maloof. He approached, face wreathed in a tremulous smile. &#x201c;Sir, in talking with my colleagues, I find that we are united in admiration for the clarity of your wisdom!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Maloof. &#x201c;That is good to hear.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But we also feel that certain of your views are so abstract as to insulate you from the woes of humanity. It is our sincere hope that you have reconsidered our unhappy situation, that perhaps you have reached a better understanding, and now feel a surge of sympathy for our plight; am I right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You could not be more wrong. My recommendation is as before.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kalash threw up his arms in defeat and turned away. The pilgrims gathered to confer, and decided to ask Schwatzendale to return his winnings. Wingo overheard their muttered plans and assured them that Schwatzendale would &#x201c;rather drain blood from his leg than relinquish money, once it had come into his possession.&#x201d;</p> <p>Schwatzendale himself joined the conversation. He asked Perrumpter Kalash: &#x201c;Would you have returned my losses had you depredated my wealth? Remember, if you will, that I too have feelings!&#x201d;</p> <p>The pilgrims murmured resentfully, then left the ship and straggled off toward the Labor Exchange. Captain Maloof and Myron went off to the warehouse to arrange for the discharge of cargo. Moncrief, along with Flook, Pook and Snook, set off toward the center of town, with Hunzel and Siglaf hunching behind.</p> <p>Wingo and Schwatzendale, before leaving the ship, changed into shoreside clothes. Wingo donned dust-brown breeches, a gray-pink shirt with a black string cravat, his loose brown cloak and the brown planter&#x2019;s hat with the sweeping brim &#x2014; a costume harking back to those gallant artists who swaggered with such �lan across the early romantic eras. His sensitive feet were at ease in the fine boots of soft leather by which he set great store. Schwatzendale wore black breeches, a shirt patterned in a black and green diaper, a soft black cap pulled askew over his black locks. They set off along the Pomare Boulevard, walking under a rustling canopy of overhanging foliage and sweet-smelling flowers.</p> <p>The trees were of many varieties: some indigenous, others brought from far worlds. Certain of the trees towered grandly on high; others crouched contorted, with heavy limbs spreading fans of foliage over the roadway. Silurian elms displayed fronds of pale blue and sea-green; dendrons released lobes of gas-filled membrane which floated off down the boulevard, loaded with spores. Quake-trees, nectarcups hanging on corkscrew tendrils, bobbed and bounced to spill perfume into the air.</p> <p>Schwatzendale trotted along in jaunty high spirits. He danced first ahead of Wingo&#x2019;s staunch and steady gait, then off to the side to pluck a flower, which a moment later he flung over his shoulder in flamboyant disregard for the law. Wingo watched benignly and paused to pick up Schwatzendale&#x2019;s litter, which he tucked into his pocket.</p> <p>The two passed the Labor Exchange: a long open-sided shed thatched with tawny palm fronds, overhung by talisman trees. Behind a counter, a single clerk attended to the needs of a stout woman wearing black boots and wide orange pantaloons. The pilgrims, meanwhile, stood in a glum huddle reading notices on a bulletin board, striking from time to time at flying insects.</p> <p>Wingo and Schwatzendale continued along the way. Wingo was inclined to commiserate with the pilgrims, citing the inconveniences of their present plight. Schwatzendale was more detached. &#x201c;They were not compelled to march off on this fateful expedition! Had they stayed at home, they might have slept in their own beds, or performed religious rites whenever the notion took them, each to their heart&#x2019;s content.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They are driven by something called &#x2018;afflatus&#x2019;,&#x201d; Wingo told him. &#x201c;It is an all-consuming force which cannot be explained.&#x201d;</p> <p>Schwatzendale nodded his comprehension. They proceeded, passing the premises of the Tarquin Transit Company, which offered rental vehicles of all kinds, some fanciful and ostentatious, others built for speed, low in front with tall spindly wheels behind. There were flitters of local construction, so fragile and light that it seemed as if the wind might carry them away.</p> <p>Taking in the sights Schwatzendale and Wingo went on, dodging the occasional skitter which trundled along the boulevard. They noticed several bungalows, almost hidden in the foliage, then came upon a rambling structure built of old boards and panels of compressed grass, under a high-peaked roof of palm thatch. A sagging porch ran along the front, with three wooden steps connecting porch to ground. Above the porch hung a sign: Pingis Tavern. Wingo and Schwatzendale stopped short. They appraised the raffish structure with practiced eyes, then with one accord they turned aside, mounted the steps and entered the tavern.</p> <p>They were met by a familiar odor: the scent of old wood permeated by generations of spilled beer, along with the must of dry palm. At this time of day, business was slow. The interior was dim and quiet. At the back a pair of stout ladies gossiped earnestly over small beers. A gentleman of evident respectability leaned against the bar, clasping a goblet of pale liquor in his right hand. He wore a smart blue tunic, breeches of black whipcord, black ankle-boots of good quality. His face was long and sober, under a neatly ordered ruff of crisp brown hair. A short square beard emphasized the sobriety of his features. He nodded politely as Wingo and Schwatzendale seated themselves at a scarred wooden table.</p> <p>On the wall behind the bar a board listed a dozen special drinks in an illegible scrawl. The brown-bearded gentleman watched tolerantly for a moment, then volunteered advice: &#x201c;Balrob, our host, is a man of good reputation, and I can vouch for his bitter ale.&#x201d;</p> <p>Balrob bowed in gratification. &#x201c;Thank you, Sir Agent! Your commendation carries weight.&#x201d;</p> <p>The gentleman straightened to an erect posture. &#x201c;Allow me to introduce myself; I am Efram Shant, La...</p></p><h2>Night Sky Atlas: The Moon, Planets, Stars and Deep Sky Objects</h2><p><p> Praise for the previous edition: : <br> <b><i>An ideal portable reference for backyard astronomers.

You need no prior knowledge -- just add your own enthusiasm. Using a combination of maps of different scales and methods of plotting, you can discover the appearance of the stars wherever and whenever you observe. </p><p> A special feature of this atlas is realistic views of the constellations that match as closely as possible what you actually see in the sky, with no labels or grid lines to clutter the page. Facing each one is a conventional map of the same area that you can use to identify the stars and constellations. </p><p> Having found your way among the stars, you will want to study the other objects -- the Sun, Moon and planets and the much more distant nebulae, star clusters and galaxies. The most interesting constellations are described in detail, with illustrations that show the objects of interest in a variety of ways, from drawings that match accurately what you can see through a small telescope to images taken through large telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope. Notes give you the basics of observational methods and help you to find and observe the objects, whether you have the simplest telescope or an up-to-the-minute computerized model. </p><p> A special website, www.stargazing.org.uk, accompanies this atlas to provide regularly updated links to sites giving further information and planetary positions, so you can always keep up-to-date.

He was in Russia in 1917 and witnessed the Revolution, which he reported for the Manchester Guardian. After escaping to Scandinavia, he settled in the Lake District of England with his Russian wife where, in 1929, he wrote <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>. Thus began a writing career that has produced some of the best children&#x2019;s literature of all time.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Collected Fictions</h2><p>This is a collection of Borges&#39;s fiction, translated and gathered into a single volume. From his 1935 debut with &#34;The Universal History of Iniquity&#34;, through the influential collections &#34;Ficciones&#34; and &#34;The Aleph&#34;, to his final work from the 1980s, &#34;Shakespeare Memory&#34;.</p><p>Although Jorge Luis Borges published his first book in 1923--doling out his own money for a limited edition of <i>Fervor de Buenos Aires</i>--he remained in Argentinian obscurity for almost three decades. In 1951, however, <i>Ficciones</i> appeared in French, followed soon after by an English translation. This collection, which included the cream of the author's short fictions, made it clear that Borges was a world-class (if highly unclassifiable) artist--a brilliant, lyrical miniaturist, who could pose the great questions of existence on the head of pin. And by 1961, when he shared the French Prix Formentor with Samuel Beckett, he seemed suddenly to tower over a half-dozen literary cultures, the very exemplar of modernism with a human face. <p> By the time of his death in 1986, Borges had been granted old master status by almost everybody (except, alas, the gentlemen of the Swedish Academy). Yet his work remained dispersed among a half-dozen different collections, some of them increasingly hard to find. Andrew Hurley has done readers a great service, then, by collecting all the stories in a single, meticulously translated volume. It's a pleasure to be reminded that Borges's style--poetic, dreamlike, and compounded of innumerable small surprises--was already in place by 1935, when he published <i>A Universal History of Iniquity</i>: "The earth we inhabit is an error, an incompetent parody. Mirrors and paternity are abominable because they multiply and affirm it." (Incidentally, the thrifty author later recycled the second of these aphorisms in his classic bit of bookish metaphysics, "Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Teris.") The glories of his middle period, of course, have hardly aged a day. "The Garden of the Forking Paths" remains the best deconstruction of the detective story ever written, even in the post-Auster era, and "Pierre Menard, Author of the <i>Quixote</i>" puts the so-called death of the author in pointed, hilarious perspective. </p><p> But Hurley's omnibus also brings home exactly how consistent Borges remained in his concerns. As late as 1975, in "Avelino Arredondo," he was still asking (and occasionally even answering) the same riddles about time and its human repository, memory: "For the man in prison, or the blind man, time flows downstream as though down a slight decline. As he reached the midpoint of his reclusion, Arredondo more than once achieved that virtually timeless time. In the first patio there was a wellhead, and at the bottom, a cistern where a toad lived; it never occurred to Arredondo that it was the toad's time, bordering on eternity, that he sought." Throughout, Hurley's translation is crisp and assured (although this reader will always have a soft spot for "Funes, the Memorious" rather than "Funes, His Memory.") And thanks to his efforts, Borgesians will find no better--and no more pleasurable--rebuttal of the author's description of himself as "a shy sort of man who could not bring himself to write short stories." <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Borges was born in Buenos Aires in 1899.

The archaeological finds included the remains of textiles, plants, and animals, and some female terra-cotta figures that suggested the existence of a "mother goddess" cult.<br><br>The initial excavation was interrupted in 1965, and answers to the riddles of this Neolithic site remained unresolved until Ian Hodder initiated a new campaign of research in the 1990s. Described by Colin Renfrew as "one of the most ambitious excavation projects currently in progress, undertaken at one of the world's great archaeological sites," this has been a truly multidisciplinary undertaking, involving the participation of over one hundred archaeologists, scientists, and specialists. Hodder and his colleagues have established that this great site, dating back some 9,000 years, provides the key to understanding the most important change in human existence&#x2014;the time when people moved into villages and towns, adopted farming as a way of life, and began to accept domination of one social group by another. Through meticulous excavation procedures and laboratory analyses, they peel back the layers of history to reveal how people lived and died and how they engaged with one another, with their environment, and with the spirit world.<br><br>Full of insights into past lives and momentous events, <i>The Leopard's Tale</i> is superbly illustrated with images of the art, the excavations, and the people involved in this world-famous dig.</p><p><b>Ian Hodder</b> is Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University and one of the world's foremost archaeologists.

He&#39;s written about Katarina Witt behind the Iron Curtain, wrestling priests in Mexico City, and (reluctantly) accompanying models on the swimsuit issue. His level-headed and often hilarious approach has earned him a devoted readership. This collection presents the best of Reilly: unforgettable sporting moments, favorite columns, and unpublished pieces.</p><p>Rick Reilly, the mainstay of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>'s back page, is a writer with a facile short game, but, as <i>The Life of Reilly</i> makes clear, he was born to go long. As entertaining, clever, witty, and, at times, irate as his rants and raves at the end of each week's issue can be, it's the sheer talent and bravura he displays in the features he's penned for the magazine that best exhibit why he's considered one of the finest sportswriters of our time. If his columns have a way of constantly poking you in the ribs, the longer pieces can sometimes take your breath away.<p> While <i>The Life of Reilly</i> covers the bases of all major and most other sports, Reilly's writing about golf is especially stellar, and three pieces alone--his chronicle of a round of golf with President Clinton, his account of O.J. Simpson's trials on public golf courses, and his reportage, on deadline, of Jack Nicklaus's sixth victory at Augusta--are worth the volume's greens fee. As beautifully as Reilly can paint the big picture, these pieces display his uncanny eye for detail, his skills as a reporter, and his inventiveness as a writer. On Nicklaus's improbable Masters title at age 46: "Maybe Nicklaus had drawn up a contract with Lucifer for one last major, for that slippery 20th that had eluded him since 1980, for a sixth green blazer. In exchange, Nicklaus would do pro-ams in Hades for the rest of his days. What else could explain it?" What else, indeed.</p><p> Reilly provides short postscripts to most of the pieces--some are just pithy, while others open windows onto the writer's craft. They're a nice touch, but then, Reilly's work, in general, is full of them. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i></p>"He's that rare sports guy who can write about so much more than sports, even when he's writing about sports." -- <i>Bill Husted, Denver Post</i><br><br>"Rick Reilly has the best combination of wit and insight in sports writing today." -- <i>Mark Emmons, San Jose Mercury News</i><br><br>When Jim Murray died, Reilly said "Murray could write anything," Reilly said, "sports just happened to get lucky." Ditto, Reilly. -- <i>Greg Barrett, Gannett News Service, December 6, 2000</i><br><br>When Reilly's friend, mentor and Los Angeles Times legend Jim Murray died two years ago, Reilly called him the greatest sports writer who ever lived. "Murray coould write anything," Reilly said, "sports just happened to get lucky." --<i>Greg Barrett, Gannett News Service, December 6, 2000</i></p><h2>The Little Briton Bistro</h2><p>From the New York Times and internationally bestselling author of The Little Paris Bookshop, an extraordinary novel about self-discovery and new beginnings. Marianne Messman longs to escape her loveless marriage to an uncaring husband - an artillery sergeant major named Lothar. On a day trip to Paris, Marianne decides to leap off the Pont Neuf into the Seine, but she is saved from drowning by a homeless man. While recovering in hospital, Marianne comes across a painting of the tiny port town of Kerdruc in Brittany and decides to try her luck on the coast. In Kerdruc, Marianne meets a host of colourful characters who all gravitate around the restaurant of Ar Mor (The Sea). It is this cast of true Bretons who become Marianne&#39;s new family, and among whom she will find love once again.

Millions across the nation welcomed him into their homes, first as a print reporter for the United Press on the front lines of World War II, and later, in the emerging medium of television, as a host of numerous documentary programs and as anchor of the <em>CBS Evening News</em>, from 1962 until his retirement in 1981. Yet this very public figure, undoubtedly the twentieth century's most revered journalist, was a remarkably private man; few know the full story of his life. Drawing on unprecedented access to Cronkite's private papers as well as interviews with his family and friends, Douglas Brinkley now brings this American icon into focus as never before.</p> <p>Brinkley traces Cronkite's story from his roots in Missouri and Texas through the Great Depression, during which he began his career, to World War II, when he gained notice reporting with Allied troops from North Africa, D-day, and the Battle of the Bulge. In 1950, Edward R. Murrow recruited him to work for CBS, where he covered presidential elections, the space program, Vietnam, and the first televised broadcasts of the Olympic Games, as both a reporter and later as an anchor for the evening news. Cronkite was also witness to&#x2014;and the nation's voice for&#x2014;many of the most profound moments in modern American history, including the Kennedy assassination, Apollos 11 and 13, Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the Iran hostage crisis.</p> <p>Epic, intimate, and masterfully written, Cronkite is the much-anticipated biography of an extraordinary American life, told by one of our most brilliant and respected historians.</p><p>Douglas Brinkley is the Katherine Tsanoff Brown Chair in Humanities and Professor of History at Rice University, a CNN Presidential Historian, and a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>.&nbsp; In the world of public history, he serves on boards, at museums, at colleges, and for historical societies. The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> dubbed him &#x201c;America&#x2019;s New Past Master.&#x201d; The New-York Historical Society has chosen Brinkley as its official U.S. Presidential Historian. His recent book <em>Cronkite</em> won the Sperber Prize, while <em>The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast </em>received the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award.

Visit her at graegin.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;When her grandmother begins exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's disease, Julia and her parents must come to terms with the illness and get her the care she needs. Grandma's slow alteration rings true: forgetting names, losing the car in a parking lot, and getting lost in a oft-visited place. Though the illustrations depict the child as quite young, her narration is rather adult in tone: "I remember when Grandma was still her old sweet self," "ever so slowly, like a low tide leaving the bay, a change came along," and, "When she sees her bed all abloom...." The mother's explanation of the disease is nonthreatening and easy for a child to understand. The pencil and ink washes, finished digitally and varying in size, subtly show how Grandma is becoming forgetful, from the dying plants and a watering can in the house to her mismatched socks and unkempt hair. Pair this with Mary Bahr's The Memory Box (Albert Whitman, 1992), which introduces the idea of how to preserve memories before they are lost forever.&#x2014;Maryann H.

As he slowly reveals himself, Vick becomes convinced that he suffers from a complex set of delusions: Y__, as she refers to him, claims to be a scientist who has stolen cloaking technology from an aborted government project in order to render himself nearly invisible. He says he uses this ability to observe random individuals within their daily lives, usually when they are alone and vulnerable. Unsure of his motives or honesty, Vick becomes obsessed with her patient and the disclosure of his increasingly bizarre and disturbing tales. Over time, it threatens her career, her marriage, and her own identity. <br> <br>Interspersed with notes, correspondence, and transcriptions that catalog a relationship based on curiosity and fear, <i>The Visible Man </i>touches on all of Chuck Klosterman&#x2019;s favorite themes&#x2014;the consequence of culture, the influence of media, the complexity of voyeurism, and the existential contradiction of normalcy. Is this comedy, criticism, or horror? Not even Y__ seems to know for sure.</p><p>Chuck Klosterman is the bestselling author of many books of nonfiction (including <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs, I Wear the Black Hat, Fargo Rock City </i>and <i>Chuck Klosterman X</i>) and two novels (<i>Downtown Owl </i>and <i>The Visible Man</i>).

The entrance swung open and a man stepped into the room. I knew who he was before he told me. There were no surprises.<br> <br>He was a man. A strange-looking man, but nothing more.<br> <br>He was tall and he was thin. Cadaverous. Perhaps six feet five or six feet six, but no more than 175 pounds. His head was a skull on a stick; it was shaved to the skin, but I could see a subtle shadow where his hair would sprout. The hairline was receding. He wore an oversized black T-shirt, khaki pants, and garish white tennis shoes. His arms were wiry and unnaturally long. His nose was large, as were his Adam&#x2019;s apple and his ears. His teeth were jagged and yellow. &#x201c;Ichabod Crane,&#x201d; I thought to myself. &#x201c;He looks like an actor auditioning for the role of Ichabod Crane.&#x201d; It was a sweltering day in May, but he was barely sweating. I can recall this because I asked him where he had parked his car (at the time, I was in the midst of a minor parking dispute with a neighboring office building and lived in constant fear that my patients might get towed). He mentioned that he had arrived on foot. I could not imagine how a man in a black T-shirt could walk any distance in the 90-degree Texas heat without perspiring, but Y____ was immune. When he shook my hand, it was cool and dry, like a brick from the cellar.<br> <br>I turned on the tape recorder.<br> <br>When I treat patients in my office, I never sit behind my desk. The desk creates a barrier, and barriers are the enemy. Instead, I sit in a white Eames chair. My patients have the option of sitting in an identical black Eames chair or on the couch. No one ever takes the couch, particularly during their first session (too overt). Y____ looked at both options and requested that he sit in my chair. I said, &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s not how things work here.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know why I used those specific words. Y____ asked, &#x201c;Does it matter where I sit? Can&#x2019;t I sit in the white chair?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If it doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; I responded, &#x201c;then why not sit in the black chair, like everyone else who comes here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I have a preference,&#x201d; said Y____. &#x201c;I prefer white objects. If I express a preference for white objects, why not allow me to sit in the white chair?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps I have my own preference,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have a preference?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. I prefer the white chair. The white chair is my preference.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then by all means, take the white chair,&#x201d; said Y____. &#x201c;I would never interfere with your preference.&#x201d;<br> <br>We both sat. I smiled. He smiled back, but only for a moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;So here I am,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You wanted to see me, and now you have. This is your office, and I am here. I&#x2019;m in your office.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Thank you for coming in. It&#x2019;s really nice to see you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes. Of course. Of course it&#x2019;s nice. Let&#x2019;s talk about how nice it is. This is a wonderful office&#x2014;you have plants, carpeting, a relatively quiet air conditioner. It&#x2019;s contemporary in a classic way, or perhaps vice versa. Can we get to work now? Or do we still need to have a pretend conversation about how much your rent is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can absolutely get to work,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good attitude. I&#x2019;ve really been enjoying our work thus far. The progress has been, you know&#x2014;<i>progressive</i>. But let me ask you something, before we get going: You mentioned that you liked white objects. That&#x2019;s an interesting thing to like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what if I think it&#x2019;s interesting?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What if I think it&#x2019;s not? There&#x2019;s no meaning here, Vicky. My affinity for the color white doesn&#x2019;t say anything about me. Look, we&#x2019;re not going to do this. You need to accept that. I already understand the process. We both understand the process. I don&#x2019;t need to slowly grow comfortable with the conceit, and you don&#x2019;t need to understand why I like white objects. Let&#x2019;s get to the provocation. Let&#x2019;s start with what matters: You think I&#x2019;m telling a fictional story. Your stomach tells you that I&#x2019;m telling the truth, but your mind insists your stomach is crazy. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this all week. When we last spoke on the phone, I realized I misspoke. I said that I didn&#x2019;t care if you believed me. That&#x2019;s not accurate. That was my mistake. What I meant to say is that I don&#x2019;t care if you think I&#x2019;m <i>an honest person</i>. I don&#x2019;t care if you think I&#x2019;m a good person or a bad person. But I do need you to believe the specific things I&#x2019;ve told you. If you don&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve done the things I&#x2019;ve done, it will derail our conversation. You will hear everything I say as an extension of a delusion, and the content will get ignored. I will say things like, &#x2018;I once saw Event A happen to Subject Zed,&#x2019; and you will wonder, &#x2018;What is his inner motive for telling that particular story about this particular fabrication? What does this story <i>represent</i>?&#x2019; But that won&#x2019;t be what&#x2019;s happening. Anything I elect to tell you won&#x2019;t be theoretical or metaphorical. It will be something real that happened in my life. So I need you to believe that what I&#x2019;ve said&#x2014;and what I will continue to say&#x2014;is not untrue.&#x201d;<br> <br>Y____ stood up from the chair, jarringly, throwing himself upward by pushing down on the armrests. It was like watching a giraffe awaken from a tranquilizer. &#x201c;May I walk about,&#x201d; he asked. He began to pace around the room, erratically, looking down at the floor while gesturing with his hands. This behavior is what I&#x2019;d come to classify as &#x201c;the Y____ Character.&#x201d; Whenever Y____ became &#x201c;the Y____ Character,&#x201d; his dialogue would feel rehearsed. It was like watching a one-man show. Though I&#x2019;d already experienced several of these moments over the phone, this was the first time I witnessed it with my eyes. Over time, I&#x2019;ve come to accept that the Y____ Character was (probably) the real Y____. It was everything else that was (probably) the show.<br> <br>&#x201c;So how can we do this?&#x201d; Y____ continued. He loved semirhetorical questions. &#x201c;How can I make you believe me? What could I do, short of being cloaked in front of you, to make you accept my words at face value?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an intriguing question,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s an impossible thing for me to accept. So if I never accept this, how will it make you feel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Vicky, we&#x2019;re not doing this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not doing some kind of exercise where I make a declarative statement and you ask me how I feel about that declaration. We&#x2019;re not going to talk about my <i>development</i> or my <i>primal memories</i>. Maybe we will eventually, but not today. Right now, today, I need you to tell me how I can make you believe I&#x2019;m not like other people. That I can do things other people cannot.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stopped pacing and looked at me, frozen, waiting, saying nothing. The moment I began to respond, he commenced his pace.<br> <br>&#x201c;If there were some witnesses to this partial invisibility,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and those witnesses came in here and verified what you had said, honestly and scientifically, I might believe you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are no witnesses to my life,&#x201d; Y____ said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the keys to being unseen: If there are witnesses, something went wrong. So what else?&#x201d; His pacing continued.<br> <br>&#x201c;Video evidence,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A videotape of you doing something that only an invisible person could do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would prove nothing,&#x201d; said Y____. This was a game to him. &#x201c;I could fake that with any computer. And even if my video was perfect&#x2014;even if it was so seamless and unimpeachable that it couldn&#x2019;t be faked by a moviemaker&#x2014;you&#x2019;d still assume it was somehow unreal. You would merely think it was the best fake you&#x2019;ve ever seen. You&#x2019;d believe I was David Fincher before you&#x2019;d accept who I actually am. Try again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Any reported evidence that this could be done. A <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article that describes your research. A textbook about the process.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no such article or textbook,&#x201d; said Y____. &#x201c;I would be the only person who could write it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you should do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not my thing. Not anymore. I hate writing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Y____ returned to the black chair. He was smirking. I asked if he wanted coffee. He said he didn&#x2019;t want coffee or need coffee. He seemed calm, smug. Not very adult. More like a high school senior in the final days of May.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, what about <i>this</i>,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;What if you just considered everything I&#x2019;ve told you and weighed that information against the degree to which I seem credible?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve been doing,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;From the first day you called me on the telephone, I&#x2019;ve been calculating that very equation. I&#x2019;ve taken what you&#x2019;ve said at face value, and I&#x2019;ve considered the source. I&#x2019;ve tried to be as open-minded and nonjudgmental as possible. I&#x2019;ve taken all your statements seriously and professionally, and I&#x2019;ve come to a conclusion. Do you want to know what that conclusion is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure? Do you promise to be as open-minded and fair with me as I have been with you? Because that&#x2019;s essential.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes. Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then my diagnosis is this,&#x201d; I said, as evenly as possible. &#x201c;You are an educated, affluent, highly functioning person who has experienced a break from the life you used to live. You have become obsessed with an imaginary life, and you use your natural intellect as a crutch to make that imaginary life real. This allows you to ignore the pain that still exists from whatever caused that break to happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited for a reaction, but he said nothing. His expression did not change.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, that probably sounds very bad to you, and perhaps even insulting,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell if you already know I&#x2019;m right, or if you&#x2019;re about to walk out my door and never speak to me again. Obviously, I have no control over what you do or how you react. But this is a solvable problem. Your very presence in my office proves you understand that. You want to get better, and you know that a better life is possible. So here is what I want to do: I want both of us to get in my car and drive to Seton Medical Center. They don&#x2019;t have to admit you and you won&#x2019;t need to stay overnight. However, they will conduct a short interview and a few tests in order to decide what the next step should be. From that point on, it&#x2019;s totally your decision. There are people there who are better suited to deal with this situation than me. If you want to continue using me as your primary therapist, that would be fantastic. I enjoy working with you, and I care about what happens to you. But you need to talk to a medical doctor, and I am not a medical doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Y____ waited until I finished. He wordlessly thought about what I had said (and seemed to treat my words seriously). But then he stood up and resumed pacing, instantly rematerializing as the Y____ Character. It was as if I had said nothing at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about this,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;What if I told you something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly know? What if I knew something that could only be known by someone who was able to make themselves unseen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what that would be, and I&#x2019;m not sure what that would prove.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You read a Malcolm Gladwell book last year,&#x201d; Y____ said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You read a Malcolm Gladwell book. Last winter. Try and tell me that you didn&#x2019;t read a Malcolm Gladwell book last winter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does that have to do with anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That happened. Right? It happened. So how do I know this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What Malcolm Gladwell book did I read?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember. One of them. The first one, or maybe the other one. The third one? All the covers look the same to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, the fact that I read a book by one of the most popular writers in America, an author who sells several million books every year&#x2014;this proves you have the ability to be invisible?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I would have liked to use a more specific example. But you don&#x2019;t seem to read many books.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, what ... are you implying that you&#x2019;ve been watching me? Is that what you&#x2019;re claiming? Because that&#x2019;s a crime. Be careful what you say right now, Y____. Don&#x2019;t make up a story that will create a new problem for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s why I only mentioned the Gladwell book,&#x201d; Y____ said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to scare you. If I told you something too specific&#x2014;if I told you the color of your living room carpet, for example&#x2014;you&#x2019;d probably freak out. I&#x2019;m not going to freak you out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is the color of my living room carpet, Y____?&#x201d;<br> <br>He said nothing. Maybe he smiled, but I can&#x2019;t be certain.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a reason you&#x2019;re not telling me the color of my living room carpet,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;And the reason is not that you don&#x2019;t want to scare me. The reason is that you don&#x2019;t know what the color of my carpet is. Now, maybe you <i>think</i> you know, or maybe you <i>know</i> you don&#x2019;t know. I can&#x2019;t tell. Right now, that&#x2019;s our problem. And this is why we need to go to Seton Medical. <i>This</i>&#x2014;this scenario, right here. This thing we are dealing with, right now. This incongruity. <i>This</i> is the problem. Not your guilt over spying on people, not the stress from being an &#x2018;almost invisible&#x2019; man. Nothing that involves the outside world. Our problem is the chasm between who you are and who you want to be. Everyone deals with this problem, Y____. Everyone. You are not alone. Half the work I do with my other patients is about the difference between who someone is and who they wish they were. The only difference here is the degree. You have a fixable problem. Your condition just happens to be a little more severe than what I typically encounter. But I am on your side here. Do you see that? I want to help you.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the next thirty seconds, I thought I&#x2019;d broken through. Y____ stopped walking and stood at the center of my office. He looked sad. He looked defeated. There was a moment when I anticipated (hoped?) that Y____ was going to cry. But then he changed entirely. His concern melted into stoicism, and then evaporated into low-level joy. He smiled and ran a hand across his bald skull; it was like a different person had jumped inside his bones.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Vic-Vick: You win,&#x201d; he said. I thought this meant we were going to Seton Medical Center. It did not. &#x201c;Next week. I will see you next week. Things will be different a week from now. But just try and remember what we talked about, okay? Remember what I said today. Really think about the things I said. Digest my words. They will make sense later. How about this: If you still feel this way seven days from now, I will go to the hospital. That is my promise. But only if you&#x2019;ve <i>really</i> considered the things I&#x2019;ve told you. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>I did not believe him, but I shook my head up and down. What else could I do?<br> <br>&#x201c;Goodbye, Vicky. Your skepticism is adorable. Don&#x2019;t ever lose that, no matter what happens.&#x201d;<br> <br>And with that, Y____ walked out of my office. For the rest of the day, I seethed at my desk. He had dodged me again, and he talked to me like a child. He was so uniquely troubled. I should have known what was coming, but of course I did not.<br><br>� 2011 Chuck Klosterman</p><h2>Playback</h2><p>Stalking the tawdry neon wilderness of forties and fifties Los Angeles, Raymond Chandler&#39;s hard-drinking, wise-cracking Phillip Marlowe is one of the world&#39;s most famous fictional detectives. &#34;Playback&#34; finds Marlowe mixing business with pleasure - getting paid to follow a mysterious and lovely red-head named Eleanor King. And wherever Miss King goes, trouble seems to follow. But she&#39;s easy on the eye and Marlowe&#39;s happy to do as he&#39;s told, all in the name of chivalry, of course. But one dead body later and what started out as a lazy afternoon&#39;s snooping soon becomes a deadly cocktail of blackmail, lies, mistaken identity - and murder...</p><p>Marlowe is hired by an influential lawyer he's never herd of to tail a gorgeous redhead, but decides he prefers to help out the redhead.

He was educated at Dulwich College, London and studied international law in France and Germany. He published a number of poems and essays in local papers and worked as a reporter, essayist, and book reviewer. After serving for the Canadian Army during World War I he became a bookkeeper and auditor for Dabney Oil Syndicate. In 1939 he published <i>The Big Sleep</i> to instant acclaim in Britain and the US, introducing the world to his iconic private eye, Philip Marlowe. With <i>Farewell My Lovely</i> and <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, Chandler cemented his reputation as a giant of American popular culture and master of a style of detective fiction that would be widely admired and imitated. Chandler turned to screenwriting with <i>Double Indemnity</i>. He continued to write for Hollywood during the heyday of the Hollywood studio system, receiving an Oscar nomination for <i>The Blue Dahlia</i>. In 1946 Chandler received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for screenplay and in 1954 for novel writing. During the last year of his life he was made President of the Mystery Writers of America.

When the Kinsey report was published, she&#x2019;d seen it all before: &#x201c;The good doctor&#x2019;s clinical notes were old hat to me,&#x201d; she remarked.<br><br>As a girl Tallulah was short and plump, weighing almost 140 pounds and just 5&#x2019;2&#x201d;<i> </i>tall, but by the age of fifteen she had shed enough puppy fat to win a beauty contest in her home town, Montgomery, Alabama. This decided her to head for New York and try her luck as an actress. She went on to appear in over fifty plays and eighteen films, with her final appearance as a character called the &#x201c;Black Widow&#x201d; in a 1967 episode of <i>Batman</i>. <br><br>Early on, she got a reputation for partying, and was a regular user of cocaine and marijuana. She was annoyed by what she saw as <i>petit bourgeois </i>fears about drug misuse, but chose humor to confront it: &#x201c;Cocaine isn&#x2019;t addictive,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I should know: I&#x2019;ve been using it for years.&#x201d; She was equally blas� about sex. She was once asked if it was true that she had been raped as a twelve-year-old on the drive of her father&#x2019;s home. &#x201c;Yes, it was awful, truly awful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You see, we had so much gravel.&#x201d; Her early career on Broadway was a series of false starts but in 1923 she came to London to appear in a play called <i>The Dancers </i>opposite the suave elder statesman of the West End stage, Gerald du Maurier. Her lustrous hair, husky voice and exuberant cartwheels turned her into an overnight star. The writer and actor Emlyn Williams wrote that her voice &#x201c;was steeped as deep in sex as the human voice can go without drowning.&#x201d; Her most devoted fans were her &#x201c;Gallery Girls,&#x201d; a group of Cockney teenagers who cheered, stamped their feet and threw flowers onto the stage whenever she said a line. The writer Arnold Bennett was dazzled:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Ordinary stars get &#x201c;hands.&#x201d; If Tallulah gets a &#x201c;hand&#x201d; it is not heard. What is heard is a terrific, wild, passionate, hysterical roar and shriek. Only the phrase of the Psalmist can describe it: &#x201c;God is gone up with a shout.&#x201d;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Winston Churchill was a regular at her shows and before long &#x201c;to Tallulah&#x201d; had become a verb. She told an American reporter: &#x201c;Over here they like me &#x2018;to Tallulah.&#x2019;&#x201d; You know &#x2013; dance and sing and romp and fluff my hair and play reckless parts.&#x201d; After a triumphant and extravagant eight years, she returned to the USA to be signed up by Paramount who planned to make her &#x201c;the new Dietrich.&#x201d; They didn&#x2019;t: they made a string of turkeys. There was something about the nature of film that failed to capture what made her so sexy and delicious in the flesh. She continued to make the occasional movie but, through the 1930s and 1940s, her best work was on Broadway.<br>Tallulah was bisexual but liked to joke that she couldn&#x2019;t be a lesbian because &#x201c;they have no sense of humor,&#x201d; and she once let slip that she could never have an orgasm with anyone she was in love with. The only man she truly loved was an English aristocrat called Napier Sturt Alington, known as &#x201c;Naps,&#x201d; who was also bisexual. He married someone else, became a fighter pilot and died in the Battle of Britain. Tallulah married only once, in 1937, to the bit-part actor John Emery. She told friends that she had chosen him because he was &#x201c;hung like John Barrymore,&#x201d; but later confided that &#x201c;the weapon may be of admirable proportions but the shot is weak.&#x201d; They never had children and were divorced after four years. When she was thirty, Tallulah had to have a hysterectomy brought on by a bad case of gonorrhea, an infection she blamed on going to bed with Gary Cooper. Leaving hospital in a very weakened condition, and having lost a lot of weight, she barked at her doctor, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t for one minute think this has taught me a lesson!&#x201d;<br><br>She was the mistress of the one-liner. When a former lover came up to her excitedly babbling that he hadn&#x2019;t seen her for many years, she shot back: &#x201c;I thought I told you to wait in the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Arranging an assignation, she scribbled a note: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come and make love to you at five o&#x2019;clock. If I&#x2019;m late, start without me.&#x201d; She talked non-stop: one of her friends followed her around for a day, timing her with a stopwatch, and estimated that she spoke 70,000 words &#x2013; the length of a short novel. As the Hollywood publicist Howard Ditz wearily remarked, &#x201c;A day away from Tallulah is like a month in the country.&#x201d; Sometimes her mouth got her into serious trouble. Speaking to a fan magazine in 1932, Tallulah confessed that she hadn&#x2019;t had an affair for six months, adding, &#x201c;Six months is a long, long while, I WANT A MAN!&#x201d; This drew a sharp reprimand from Will Hays, Hollywood&#x2019;s censor and moral guardian, for allowing a star to indulge in &#x201c;verbal moral turpitude.&#x201d;<br><br>Tallulah took her clothes off in public so often that her friend Estelle Winwood asked, &#x201c;Why do you do that, Tallulah? You have such pretty frocks.&#x201d; She was notorious for not wearing underwear, and delighted in showing off the fact to as many people as possible. When the film crew complained of her regular exposures on the set of <i>Lifeboat </i>in 1944, Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s laconic reply was: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know whether that&#x2019;s a concern for wardrobe or hairdressing.&#x201d;<br><br>Interviewing Tallulah was never easy. When <i>Time </i>magazine tried it in 1948, their reporters came away bemused. She had played the piano, performed some ballet, told jokes, done impersonations, made them lunch, plied them with mint juleps and talked without pause&#x2014; accompanied by several dogs and her free-flying budgie, Gaylord, whom she had taught to drink champagne. (Luckily, by that time, she had got rid of her pet lion, Winston, and her chimp, King Kong.) As usual, her conversation was peppered with <i>bon mots</i>, which included, &#x201c;I never think out anything, dahling; I do it instinctively or not at all. I do things I&#x2019;d loathe in anybody else.&#x201d; Trying to pinpoint her age, the reporters sought verification from her younger sister Eugenia who sighed:<br>&#x201c;Every time Tallulah knocks a year off her age, I have to, too. I&#x2019;m not sure how long I can keep it up.&#x201d;<br><br>Success, as opposed to notoriety, returned to her life from two unexpected quarters. In 1950 she became the host of a weekly celebrity talk radio slot called &#x201c;The Big Show.&#x201d; It featured Tallulah reciting Dorothy Parker monologues, interviewing other stars and introducing comic turns by the likes of Jimmy Durante and Groucho Marx. Held together by her unpredictable charm, it became an instant hit. Then two years later her autobiography <i>Tallulah </i>went straight to the top of the best-seller lists. She had recorded most of it on a tape recorder and it reads like one long, frank, funny, opinionated Tallulah monologue.&nbsp; This welcome return to the limelight couldn&#x2019;t mask her rapid descent into dependency on drink and sleeping pills. She recruited a bevy of young men as her assistants, calling them her &#x201c;caddies.&#x201d; Although they were usually gay, they often had to sleep in her bed because she was terrified of being alone. At night, one of her boys would tape her wrists together to stop her taking any more pills. Raddled, frequently irrational, her looks a grim parody of her former beauty, she still had her sense of humor.&nbsp; Not long before she died, a fan approached her and asked if she was Tallulah Bankhead. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m what&#x2019;s left of her, darling,&#x201d; she replied.<br>Long after her death, declassified British government papers revealed that Miss Bankhead had been investigated by MI5 in the 1920s over allegations that she had corrupted the morals of pupils at Eton with indecent and unnatural acts. No conclusive proof was ever found.</p><h2>Manual of Fish Health: Everything You Need to Know About Aquarium Fish, Their Environment and Disease Prevention</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive guide to keeping fish healthy for the serious hobbyist.</b></p> <p>A healthy environment is crucial for any aquarium.

Your first priority must be to provide the best possible conditions to safeguard their health and to promote their well-being. Accepting and discharging this responsibility to the full yields three fundamental benefits. First, it will minimize stress on the fish, which is unavoidable in their unnatural captive environment. Secondly, it will lead to relatively trouble-free fishkeeping. And thirdly, well-cared-for fishes will reward you by displaying their best colors and their most natural behavior for you to enjoy. </p><p> In this opening section, we look briefly at the relationship between fish, their environment and the pathogens (i.e. the disease-causing organisms) that potentially threaten their health and survival. </p><p> <b>Fish, pathogens and the environment</b> </p><p> Since fish consist of 80 percent of the raw material that makes up the environment in which they live -- namely water -- and only a simple membrane separates the two, it is not surprising that fish are uniquely influenced by any alterations in the environment and that any fluctuations have a significant impact on their health. </p><p> Many potential fish pathogens are a constant and natural part of the environment, usually without causing disease problems and mortality. For example, fish usually carry small populations of protozoan parasites that feed mainly off surplus tissue and are kept under control by the fish's immune system. After all, it is not usually in a parasite's interest to kill its host. (There are some exceptions, however, where the parasite's life cycle involves killing the fish so that it is eaten by the next scavenging stage in the cycle.) </p><p> This unique relationship between fish, their pathogens and the total environment in which they live means that under normal environmental circumstances there is a balance between the fish and the pathogens. In this case, the fish's immune system keeps any problems under control. However, if there is an alteration in one or more of the environmental characteristics then there may be a shift in the balance to the benefit or detriment of either the fish or the pathogen. An example of an environmental change that runs counter to a pathogen is a fall in temperature that reduces the virulence of that pathogen, by slowing down its rate of multiplication or even halting its life cycle. </p><p> If the environmental shift is against the fish, then -- in addition to any direct physiological impact -- the fish usually becomes stressed, its immune system is suppressed and it becomes more susceptible to disease. In this situation a disease outbreak may occur, particularly if the environmental shift also favors the pathogen. As an example Flexibacter bacteria are commonly present in fish-holding water, but the fish's immune system keeps them at bay. However, when excess food rots in the environment the bacterial population rises and, as the bacteria break the food down, they produce excess amounts of ammonia. Ammonia is a toxin that irritates the fish's gills, causing them to overproduce a layer of cells on the delicate gill surface. Since these cells are more prone to bacterial infection, the combined effect of these circumstances is an episode of bacterial gill disease in the fish. </p><p> Another relevant disease-causing factor is the introduction of disease organisms into the environment on fish, plants or decorations. This can result in the introduction of some types of pathogen that, as a consequence of their action, inevitably kill the fish host. The introduction of different types or strains of pathogens will also upset the natural immunobiological balance of a community of fishes. The indigenous fishes will have developed a degree of immunity to most of the disease organisms in their environment but may not have encountered the new strains of pathogen being brought in. On the other hand, the newly introduced fishes will also have to develop an immunity to the population of pathogens in their new environment. Therefore, introducing new fishes greatly increases the chances of a disease outbreak occurring. This underlines the importance of careful quarantining, a simple precaution that reduces the likelihood of disease when you are building up a fish population from different sources. (For guidance on quarantine, see pages 70-73.) </p><p> <b>Stress and disease</b> </p><p> Stress is a vital factor in fish health. The varied forms it takes and its effects on fish have been investigated by biologists and fisheries scientists in both wild and captive fish populations. Here, we draw some simple conclusions from what is a highly complex story. </p><p> Factors that have a negative impact on fishes, such as handling, overcrowding, poor environmental conditions and unsuitable or aggressive tankmates, are called 'stressors'. The stress response these stressors cause is defined as the sum of the physiological responses the fish makes to maintain or regain its normal balance. Some stress responses are common to all stressors; others are specific to one particular type. </p><p> The most basic stress response is to escape from imposed danger, which may take the form of a natural predator or, in captivity, the fishkeeper attempting to catch the fish in a net for closer examination or transfer it to another tank or pond. The first part of this response is the preparation of the body for escape, which, in biological terms, involves the release of hormones that channel all the fish's energy to power the locomotory muscles. Unfortunately, this alarm response has long-term detrimental effects. For example, one of the hormones released is adrenaline, which apart from 'quickening' the body for instant action also disturbs the osmoregulation (i.e. control of the salt/water balance) within the fish. Another hormone involved, cortisol, affects the white blood cells and reduces their effectiveness in the immune system. The second part of the response involves the recovery of the fish's equilibrium. Thus, the alarm response is clearly a compromise between the short-term need to reach immediate safety and the longer term side-effects of the physiological changes involved. It can be an uneven compromise; a fish that undergoes an alarm response as a result of stress applied for even a short period of time can take hours or even days to recover its equilibrium. </p><p> The stress response in fish is generally considered to be less well suited to reacting to chronic environmental stressors. This is because fish have evolved in a relatively stable natural environment and have not, therefore, developed an effective system to deal with environmental changes or chronic stressors. In the case of a negative environmental change, a fish's first response is also an alarm stage, in which it attempts to get away from the problem. If escape is not possible, then it is followed by an adaptive stage during which the fish's body attempts to react to the environmental change. Initially the fish's physiological compensation tends to over-react. Then, over a longer term, it returns to a new equilibrium in which the fish reaches optimum adaptation, both physiologically and behaviorally, to survive the new environmental conditions. During the adaptive stage of the stress response, the fish channels much of its resources into dealing with the stressor. As a result, its immune system functions less effectively and hence the fish is more prone to disease problems. </p><p> Although a fish may successfully adapt to new conditions, its performance in terms of growth, breeding and disease immunity may be reduced. This adaptive stage may last from four to six weeks. If a fish is constantly exposed to stressors such as a steady deterioration of environmental conditions or continual bullying by tank-mates the adaptive stress response is likely to be so extended, and the fish's normal functions so disturbed, that its chances of survival are significantly reduced. If the environmental change is so great that the fish can</p></p><h2>Fresh Quilting: Fearless Color, Design, and Inspiration</h2><p><p>Brighten up any room with fun, contemporary, and functional projects exploding with sensational color! <i>Fresh Quilting</i> presents 21 brilliant designs featuring quilt artist Malka Dubrawsky's intoxicating colors and unexpected palettes.</p><p>Learn to create beautiful and lively pieces for you and your home--from modern quilts and fun pillows to flirty bags and scarves.

I paused to breathe in the thick air. The roar of the kilns sounded as sweet as my mother's voice.<br><br>"Opal!" Aydan yelled above the noise. "Are you going to stand there all day? We have work to do." He gestured with a thin gnarled hand.<br><br>I hurried to join him. Working in the heat had turned his gray hair into a frizzy mop. Dirt streaked his hands. He grimaced in pain when he sat at his workbench, rubbing his lower back with a fist.<br><br>"You've been shoveling coal again," I admonished. He tried to look innocent, but before he could lie, I asked, "What happened to your apprentice?"<br><br>"Ran off once he figured out how hard it is to turn fire into ice." Aydan grunted.<br><br>"Well, I'm here now."<br><br>"You're late."<br><br>"Sorry, I had a... test." I sighed. Another frustrating, fruitless endeavor. Not only had I failed to light the fire, but I knocked over the candles, spilling hot wax all over my classmate Pazia's clothes and burning her skin. Her expensive silk tunic was ruined. She sneered in disdain when I offered to replace her shirt. Nothing new. Pazia's hostility spanned my entire four years at the Keep. Why would I expect my last year to be any different?<br><br>After starting my fifth year of lessons at the Magician's Keep, I had hoped to be able to do more with my magic. Pazia's abilities had grown so much since we sat next to each other during our very first session that the Master Magicians considered allowing her to take the Master-level test.<br><br>I'd learned about Sitia's history, politics, how to fight and about the uses for magic, but my ability to tap into the power source remained elusive. Doubts flared and the nagging feeling of being limited to one magical skill churned in my chest. And it didn't help my confidence when I overheard my fellow students calling me the One-Trick Wonder.<br><br>"Jealousy," Aydan had said when I told him about my nickname. "You saved Sitia."<br><br>I thought of the day-over four years ago-when I helped Liaison Yelena capture those evil souls. She had done all the work, I was merely a conduit. I tried to downplay my involvement, but Aydan remained stubborn.<br><br>"You're a hero and those children can't stand it."<br><br>Remembering his words made me smile. Calling fifteen to twenty-year-olds children was typical for Aydan, a proud curmudgeon.<br><br>He tapped my arm with a blowpipe. "Stop daydreaming and gather me a slug."<br><br>I grabbed the hollow rod and opened the oven. Intense light burst from the furnace as if a piece of the sun was trapped inside. I spun the end of the rod in the molten glass and twisted it up and out, removing a taffylike ball before my eyebrows and eyelashes could be singed off again.<br><br>The cherry-red slug on the end of the iron pulsed as if alive. Aydan blew through the pipe then covered the hole. A small bubble appeared in the molten glass. Resting the pipe on the metal arms of his gaffer's bench, Aydan rolled the pipe back and forth, shaping the glass.<br><br>I helped him as he created an intricate vase with a twist at the bottom so the piece actually rested on its side yet could still hold water. In his hands, turning glass into art appeared to be an easy task. I loved the unique properties of molten glass which could be molded into such wonderful objects. We worked for hours, but the time flew.<br><br>When he finished his artwork, Aydan stood on creaky legs and said the words that were the reason I came to help him after my Keep classes. "Your turn."<br><br>He exchanged places with me and grabbed a hollow pipe. While he gathered a slug, I made sure all the metal tools lying on the bench were in their proper places. All I needed was my annoying younger brother telling me to hurry, and my patient older sister helping me to complete the feeling of being in my family's glass factory.<br><br>Sitting at the bench was home-familiar and comfortable. Here and here alone, I was in control. The possibilities endless and no one could tell me otherwise.<br><br>All thoughts fled when Aydan placed the pipe in front of me. Glass cooled quickly and I had no time to dwell on anything but shaping the molten ball. Using metal tweezers, I pulled and plucked. When the slug transformed into a recognizable image, I blew through the end of the pipe. The piece's core glowed as if lit by an inner fire.<br><br>My one magical trick-the ability to insert a thread of magic inside the glass statue. Only magicians could see the captured light.<br><br>Aydan whistled in appreciation of the finished piece. Technically his ability to light fires with magic made him a magician, but since he didn't possess any other talent he hadn't been invited to study at the Keep. I shouldn't have been invited, either. I could make my special glass animals at my home in Booruby.<br><br>"Damn, girl." Aydan slapped me on the back. "That's a dead-on copy of Master Jewelrose's red-tailed hawk! Did you make that for her?"<br><br>"Yes. She needed another piece." I never knew what I would create when I sat down at the gaffer's bench, but my time spent helping Master Jewelrose care for her hawk must have influenced me. The core glowed bright red and called to me with a song of longing. Each of my creations had a distinctive voice that sounded inside me. No one else could hear its call.<br><br>"See? That's another talent you have." He bustled about and placed the hawk into the annealing oven so it could cool slowly. "Magicians can now communicate over vast distances with these animals of yours."<br><br>"Only those who have the power of mental communication." Another skill I lacked, mind reading. For those who possessed the ability, they only needed to hold one of my animals and they could "talk" to each other through the magic trapped inside. I'd admit to feeling a measure of pride over their usefulness, but I would never brag about it. Not like Pazia, who flaunted everything she did.<br><br>"Pah! It's still one of the most important discoveries of recent years. Stop being so modest. Here&#x2014;" he handed me a shovel "&#x2014;put more coal in the kiln, I don't want the temperature to drop overnight."<br><br>End of pep talk. I scooped up the special white coal and added it to the fire under the kiln. Since Aydan sold his glass pieces as art, he only needed one-a small shop compared to my family's eight kilns.<br><br>When I finished, my garments clung to my sweaty skin and strands of my brown hair stuck to my face. Coal dust scratched my throat.<br><br>"Can you help me mix?" Aydan asked before I could leave.<br><br>"Only if you promise to hire a new apprentice tomorrow."<br><br>He grumbled and grouched, but agreed. We mixed sands from different parts of Sitia. A secret recipe developed generations ago. It would be combined with soda ash and lime before it could be melted into glass.<br><br>As I tried to trick Aydan into telling me where the pink-colored sand came from, a messenger from the Keep arrived. A first-year student, he wrinkled his nose at the heat.<br><br>"Opal Cowan?" he asked.<br><br>I nodded and he huffed. "Finally! I've been searching the Citadel for you. You're wanted back at the Keep."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"I don't know."<br><br>"Who wants me?"<br><br>He glowed with glee as if he were my younger brother delivering news of my impending punishment from our parents.<br><br>"The Master Magicians."<br><br>I had to be in big trouble. No other reason for the Masters to send for me. As I rushed after the messenger-an ambitious fellow to be running errands for the Masters in his first year, and who'd already decided I wasn't worth talking to-I thought of the mishap this morning with Pazia. She had wanted to get me expelled from my first day. Perhaps she finally succeeded.<br><br>We hurried through the Citadel's streets. Even after four years, the city's construction still amazed me. All the buildings had been built with white marble slabs streaked with green veins. If I was alone, I would have trailed my hands over the walls as I walked, daydreaming of creating a city made of glass.<br><br>Instead, I ran past the buildings as the brilliant color dulled with the darkening sky. The Keep's guards waved us through-another bad sign. We vaulted up the stairs two at a time to reach the administration building. Nestled in the northeast corner of the Citadel, the Keep's campus with its four imposing towers marked the boundaries. Inside, the buildings had been constructed from a variety of colored marble and hardwoods.<br><br>The administration's peach-and-yellow blocks used to soothe me, but not today. The messenger abandoned me at the entrance to the Masters' meeting room. Hot from my sprint, I wanted to remove my cloak, but it hid my sweat-stained shirt and work pants. I rubbed my face, trying to get the dirt off and pulled my long hair into a neat bun.<br><br>Before I knocked, another possible reason for my summons dawned. I had lingered too long at the glass factory and missed my evening riding lesson. In the last year of instruction at the Keep, the apprentice class learned about horse care and riding to prepare us for when we graduated to magician status. As magicians we would be required to travel around the lands of the eleven clans of Sitia to render aid where needed.<br><br>Perhaps the Stable Master had reported my absence to the Masters. The image of facing the three magicians and the Stable Master together caused a chill to shake my bones. I turned away from the door, seeking escape. It opened.<br><br>"Do not hover about, child. You're not in trouble," First Magician Bain Bloodgood said. He gestured for me to follow him into the room.<br><br>With curly gray hair sticking out at odd intervals and a long blue robe, the old man's appearance didn't match his status as the most powerful magician in Sitia. In fact, Third Magician Irys Jewelrose's stern demeanor hinted at more power than Master Bloodgood's wrinkled face. And if someone passed Second Magician Zitora Cowan in the street, that person would not even think the young woman possessed enough talent to endure the Master-level test.<br><br>Sitting around an oval table, the three Masters stared at me. I quashed the desire to hide. After all, Master Blood-good had said I wasn't in trouble.<br><br>"Sit down, child," First Magician said.<br><br>I perched on the edge of my seat. Zitora smiled at me and I relaxed a bit. We were both members of the Cowan clan, and she always made time from her busy schedule to talk to me. And, at twenty-five years old, she was only six years older than me.<br><br>I glanced around the room. Maps of Sitia and Ixia decorated the walls, and an oversize geographical map with its edges dropping off the sides covered the mahogany table.<br><br>"We have a mission for you," Zitora said. She had twisted her honey-brown hair into a complex braid. The end of the braid reached her hips, but she fidgeted with it, twirling it around and through her fingers.<br><br>A mission for the Masters! I leaned forward.<br><br>"The Stormdancers' glass orbs have been shattering," Master Jewelrose said.<br><br>"Oh." I relaxed in my chair. Not a magical mission.<br><br>"Do you know how important those orbs are, child?" Master Bloodgood asked.<br><br>I remembered my lessons about the Stormdance Clan. Their magicians-called Stormdancers-had the unique ability to siphon a storm's energy into an orb. The benefits were twofold: tame the storm's killing winds and rain, and provide an energy source for the clan's other industries. "Very important."<br><br>"And this is a critical time of the year. The cooling season is when the storms from the Jade Sea are most frequent and strong," Zitora said.<br><br>"But doesn't the clan have master glassmakers? Surely they can fix the problem?"<br><br>"The old glassmaker died, child. Those left behind were trained to make the orbs, but the glass is flawed. You need to help them find and correct the problem."<br><br>Why me? I was still learning. "You need to send a master glassmaker. My father&#x2014;"<br><br>"Is in Booruby with all the other experts, but..." Master Jewelrose paused. "The problem might not be with the glass. Perhaps the old glassmaker used magic when he crafted the orbs. Perhaps magic similar to yours."<br><br>My heart melted as if thrown into a kiln. Events had become too hot too quick and the results could have cracks. I had worked with glass since I could remember, yet there was still so much to learn. "When...when do we leave?"<br><br>"Today," Zitora said.<br><br>My alarm must have been obvious.<br><br>"Time is of the essence, child." Master Bloodgood's tone saddened. "When an orb shatters, it kills a Stormdancer."<br><br></p><h2>The Way We Live With the Things We Love</h2><p>This latest addition to the The Way We Live... series, The Way We Live with the Things We Love, looks at hundreds of creative and stylish interiors decorated with personalized objects and artifacts.

Knisley&#x2019;s borderless pages and personal insights give the feeling of paging through someone&#x2019;s drawn diary, and her delicate linework is lovely.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Johanna Draper Carlson, <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lucy Knisley is one of the standout artist-writers of her generation, her storytelling assured and inviting. Her third book,&nbsp;<em>An Age of License</em>,&nbsp;picks up the themes of her first two books with increased sophistication. ... Further work from her pen can only enhance her fine reputation as an artist whose growth and exploits we delight to share.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul DiFilippo, <em>Barnes &amp; Noble Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Like the best travelogues, <em>An Age of License</em> shows you what it would be like to visit a place while reminding you that you can never have the same experience. If you liked her last book, <em>Relish: My Life in the Kitchen</em>, you should definitely check this out... This book is more thought-provoking than her other works, demonstrating growth and a challenge to readers to think about these things in their own lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Johanna Draper Carlson, <em>Comics Worth Reading</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The cleverness here is how swiftly Knisley communicates everything... So much delivered so swiftly, so easily, Knisley&#x2019;s chronicles always steering clear of both the sickeningly saccharin sweet and the angst-ridden. It nestles quite naturally in between, as light and as serious, as sad and as funny as real life often is.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Bruton, <em>Forbidden Planet International</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>An Age of License</em>... has an immediacy to it that makes it... compelling.... Knisley composes each page carefully, leading the eye through a series of little moments that add up to a real story. ...[M]y guess is that she will simply continue to mature as an artist and writer. <em>An Age of License</em> is already evidence of that.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Brigid Alverson, <em>Robot 6</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Knisley is a pleasurable picture-maker... and she engages directly with the issue of privilege as it pertains to her ability to take trips like this one.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tom Spurgeon, <em>The Comics Reporter</em></strong></p><h2>Hollywood Moon: A Novel (Hollywood Station)</h2><p>There's a saying at Hollywood station that the full moon brings out the beast--rather than the best--in the precinct's citizens. One moonlit night, LAPD veteran Dana Vaughn and "Hollywood" Nate Weiss, a struggling-actor-turned cop, get a call about a young man who's been attacking women. Meanwhile, two surfer cops known as Flotsam and Jetsam keep bumping into an odd, suspicious duo--a smooth-talking player in dreads and a crazy-eyed, tattooed biker. No one suspects that all three dubious characters might be involved in something bigger, more high-tech, and much more illegal. After a dizzying series of twists, turns, and chases, the cops will find they've stumbled upon a complex web of crime where even the criminals can't be sure who's conning whom. <br><br>Wambaugh once again masterfully gets inside the hearts and minds of the cops whose jobs have them constantly on the brink of danger. By turns heart-wrenching, exhilarating, and laugh-out-loud funny, <i>Hollywood Moon</i> is his most thrilling and deeply affecting ride yet through the singular streets of LA.</p><p><strong>Joseph Wambaugh</strong>, a former LAPD detective sergeant, is the bestselling author of 18 prior works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Choirboys</i> and <i>The Onion Field</i>. In 2004, he was named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America. He lives in southern California.At least 15 characters hit the Los Angeles streets in this book, and because of Joseph Wambaugh&#39;s colorful writing and Christian Rummel&#39;s amazing narration, all are well differentiated and fun to follow. The diverse cops Rummel nails include a Latina, an aspiring actor, a Lothario, an Asian-American woman, a fresh-faced officer, and a surfer. Villains include a disturbed teen, a frustrated actor-turned-grifter, a husky-voiced hacker, a redneck druggie, and a hip African-American. On one fateful night all their lives intertwine. Wambaugh is at the top of his game in the latest of his recent Hollywood series. He takes the time to develop the characters while keeping the plot moving. Rummel never stumbles, shifting and deftly juggling the many identities. Under a Hollywood moon, it seems, anything can happen.

Man is a travelling animal, and on these icy slopes skiing began as a means of survival.</p><p>That it has developed into the leisure and sporting pursuit of choice by so much of the globe bears testament to its elemental appeal. In polar exploration, it has changed the course of history. Elsewhere, in war and peace, it has done so too.&nbsp; The origins of skiing are bound up in with the emergence of modern man and the world we live in today.</p></p><p>Roland Huntford is the world's foremost authority on the polar expeditions and their protagonists. He is the author of the award-winning <em>Two Planks and a Passion: the Dramatic History of Skiing </em>and <em>Scott and Amundsen: Last Place on Earth</em> and he is the biographer of Shackleton and Nansen. He was the Scandinavian correspondent on <em>The Observer</em> for many years.'This is a deeply scholarly work ... Fortunately scholarly in this instance is not synonymous with dull ... Huntford manages to to bind a wealth of material together with a strong narrative thread.'Simon Redfern, <em>The Independent on Sunday</em><br><br>"The breadth of his scholarship, which includes an easy familiarity with Scandinavian texts, is extraordinary." <em>Literary Review</em><br><br>"What elevates Huntford is his comprehensive approach ... accessible and enjoyable, even to the most armchair bound of '<em>schussers</em>'." Paul Watkins, <em>The Times</em><br><br>"Could the outcome of the Second World War have been decided by the humble ski? That's the bold but surprisingly convincing claim made by Roland Huntford in Two Planks and a Passion."

Fewer know the very private Ted, and fewer still knew him as well as his friend and confidante of over 30 years, John Underwood. From vacations off the Florida Keys, to African Safaris to the beaches of Costa Rica, Underwood and Williams vacationed together and got to know each as close personal friends. Underwood draws on both his private recordings with Williams?the audio CD contains candor from Williams about a wide variety of subjects that no baseball fan has heard before?and his personal experiences to craft a book about what he learned from his friendship. Reminiscent of bestseller Tuesdays With Morrie, It&#39;s Only Me allows the private side of Williams to educate and entertain baseball fans more than they ever imagined before.</p><p>John Underwood captures Ted&#x2019;s voice as if he were sitting in the same room." &#x2014;Leigh MontvilleThat Ted Williams was a complicated figure is accepted without argument. The same can be said about his status as one of baseball&#x2019;s greatest hitters&#x2014;as well as his status as a war hero and avid outdoorsman. On just about everything else, however, opinions are greatly mixed. John Underwood knew Ted Williams for more than 30 years as a friend and as a confidant. Their friendship grew over the years, and Underwood slowly came to know Williams as few others did. Some of what he discovered about Williams did indeed square with public perceptions. Much, however, did not. It&#x2019;s Only Me: The Ted Williams We Hardly Knew punches through the mysteries and public misconceptions to offer a fresh and revealing perspective on this legend. John Underwood recorded hours of their conversations&#x2014;candid, stark, joyous, sad, anguished, profane, and triumphant discussions&#x2014;and this book reveals Williams&#x2019; unvarnished thoughts on his world, including: <p>� the mistakes of baseball, the duplicity of politicians, and the frustrations of golf � the sheer joy of serendipitous sex � whom he admired, who disappointed him, and who saved him from his own mistakes � religion, war, and his great, abiding love for the Marine Corps � reflections on Joe DiMaggio, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Richard Nixon, and John Kennedy � the ins and outs of hunting, fishing&#x2014;and cooking � and so much more . . . </p><p>A riveting audio CD complements the text and includes some of the author&#x2019;s most provocative and engaging conversations with Williams, many recorded while the friends were scouring the waters off their beloved Florida Keys, hunting sable antelope in Africa, or fishing for bonefish and tarpon in Costa Rica. From these first-hand accounts, a portrait of Williams emerges that will surprise, delight, and maybe even rankle readers. It&#x2019;s Only Me is an evocative resource for fans of Ted Williams, baseball, or great American heroes.</p></p><h2>Walking in the Garden of Souls</h2><p>After decades of listening to the dead speak, the author is ready to share the wisdom imparted on him from people who have crossed over--advice on how to make the most of life in the present. 60,000 first printing.</p><p>Someday we will return to a place of unfathomable beauty, where we live amongst all the beings we have ever loved, promises George Anderson author of <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls</i>. "It is a place we will see again only after our lifetime of struggle, hardship and hurt has earned us the reward of true and final peace." Our task is not to simply muddle through, waiting for our ticket to Eden, cautions Anderson. Rather, we must set out to create "a Garden on earth while we are here," meaning we must cultivate the same life we yearn for in the hereafter. As he did with <i>Lessons from the Light</i>, Anderson conveys messages from the departed to help us tend our garden. The advice ranges from how to plant hope in times of despair to how to water the seeds of compassion (it may start with placing money in a panhandler's palm). Sometimes the garden metaphor seems forced or clich�d. But overall, this is a book with honorable intentions, helping us understand the purpose of life on Earth. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>George Anderson not only works in the United States conducting seminars, lectures, and private appointments, but has also found wide appeal in Europe, Asia, and South Africa. He has been recognized by many in religious orders, including the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and has been the only living medium invited to Holland by the surviving members of the family of Anne Frank. He has also been featured extensively in newspapers and on television. <br>Andrew Barone is executive director of the George Anderson Grief Support Programs and a cofounder of the Foundation for Hope, an organization that helps bring the comfort and solace of bereavement programs into communities across the United States and around the world.</p><h2>The Fringes of Power: 10 Downing Street Diaries, 1939-1955</h2><p>The diaries of Winston Churchill&#39;s private secretary from 1941 to 1945 and from 1951 to 1955 provides a unique view of World War II, of Churchill&#39;s wartime activities and those of his personal staff</p><p>Colville, who was private secretary to Churchill, 19401945 and 19511955, and to Attlee and the then Princess Elizabeth in the intervening period, may have been at the fringes of power during this time but he had a remarkable view of its center, and in the latter years, when the great man had become "more like Buddha than Achilles," was in it. A sharp observer with an independent mind, a significant presence at international banquets and conferences, Churchill's righthand man, and no mean penman, Colville (Footprints in Time, The Churchillians) records his insider's impressions of world events, of Britain's top leaders, civilian and military, and, in particular, of Churchill, whose pugnacity, wit and political wisdom, along with his irascibility and inconsiderateness (offset, however, by generosity), he captures with Boswellian aplomb. Several strokes in the Churchill portrait come as a surprise: his loyalty to Chamberlain, for example; his lack of vindictiveness toward the Germans; his private view of Eisenhower; his desperate efforts to end the Cold War before leaving office; his distrust of Eden. This is one of the most interesting and readable of the major diaries of World War II and its aftermath. Photos. Foreign rights: Georges Borchardt. November 11<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.When Colville was a young diplomat assigned to 10 Downing Street as a private secretary, he began a diary that he kept, with increasing gaps, through Chamberlain's last year and through two stints with Churchill, 1940-45 and 1951-55. He also served as a secretary to the then Princess Elizabeth for two years. For this publication, he has pruned personal trivia and added narrative and explanatory matter. Since the diaries have already been mined both for Colville's other writings and for Martin Gilbert's multivolume Churchill biography, there are few surprises, but this gives a vivid picture of Churchill at work, with interesting sidelights on events and people.

Jonathan R. Eller measures the impact of the authors, artists, illustrators, and filmmakers who stimulated Bradbury's imagination throughout his first three decades. Unprecedented access to Bradbury's personal papers and other private collections provides insight into his emerging talent through his unpublished correspondence, his rare but often insightful notes on writing, and his interactions with those who mentored him during those early years. </p><p>Beginning with his childhood in Waukegan, Illinois, and Los Angeles, this biography follows Bradbury's development from avid reader to&nbsp;maturing author, making a living writing for pulp magazines. Eller illuminates the sources of Bradbury's growing interest in the human mind, the human condition, and the ambiguities of life and death--themes that became increasingly apparent in his early fiction. Bradbury's correspondence documents his frustrating encounters with the major trade publishing houses and his earliest unpublished reflections on the nature of authorship. Eller traces the sources of Bradbury's very conscious decisions, following the sudden success of The Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man, to voice controversial political statements in his fiction, and he highlights the private motivations behind the burst of creative energy that transformed his novella "The Fireman" into the classic novel Fahrenheit 451.</p><p>Becoming Ray Bradbury reveals Bradbury's emotional world as it matured through his explorations of cinema and art, his interactions with agents and editors, his reading discoveries, and the invaluable reading suggestions of older writers. These largely unexplored elements of his life pave the way to a deeper understanding of his more public achievements, providing a biography of the mind, the story of Bradbury's self-education and the emerging sense of authorship at the heart of his boundless creativity.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan R. Eller is a professor of English at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, the senior textual editor of the Institute for American Thought, and the cofounder of the Center for Ray Bradbury Studies at IUPUI. He is the coauthor of Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction and the textual editor of The Collected Stories of Ray Bradbury, Volume 1: 1938-1943.</p>"Eller shows how Bradbury found his vocation in a private world of mimeographed fanzines and couch-surfing, of transcontinental trips to the very first SF conventions, of the intense rivalries and controversies of a small enclosed world. . . . Eller&#x2019;s excellent account makes clear that one of the reasons why Bradbury came to seem an important new voice is that he was never as naive a writer as literary patrons such as Christopher Isherwood and Aldous Huxley may have assumed.&#x201d;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><p> "Every page is packed with fascinating material about one of this country&#x2019;s most beloved writers."--<i>The Washington Post</i>, Michael Dirda</p><br><br><p> "A stunningly good examination of what in Ray's life turned him into the unique, individual writer he became."--<i>Huffington Post</i><br> &nbsp;"A very Bradburyian biography."--<i>SFRA Review</i></p><br> &nbsp;<br><br><p> "Eller's work is thorough and enlightening on the subject of one of science fiction's greatest minds.&nbsp; Highly recommended not just for Bradbury fans but for all students of science fiction."--<i>Library Journal</i></p><br> &nbsp; "A treasury of otherwise unavailable information. . . .

The color lithographs and line drawings of men dressed for work that are shown here bear striking contrast to men in the streets now. That very fact makes these clothes more than interesting today, they are actually time capsules for the lifestyle of a century ago. Heavy woolen cloth that has lasted a hundred years, and practical styles that were always comfortable and smart-looking bear witness to the time before automobiles and electricity. Now they have become antiques themselves. The hundreds of cloth swatches that appear have subtle patterns and plenty of texture to withstand much use.

Expecting to find only a difficult, dreary political investigation in Belgium, Bannerman has barely settled in when tragedy strikes. His host, a fellow journalist, along with a British Cabinet minister, are discovered dead in the minister's elegant Brussels townhouse. <br>It appears that they have shot each other. But the dead journalist's young autistic daughter, Tania, was hidden in a closet during the killings, and when she draws a chilling picture of a third party--a man with no face--Bannerman suddenly finds himself a reluctant participant in a desperate murder investigation.<br>As the facts slowly begin to emerge under Bannerman's scrutiny, he comes to suspect that the shootings may have a deep and foul link with the rotten politics that brought him to Brussels in the first place. <br>And as Kale threatens to strike again, Bannerman begins to feel a change within himself. His jaded professionalism is transforming into a growing concern for the lonely and frightened Tania, and a strong attraction to a courageous woman named Sally--drawing him out of himself and into the very heart of a profound, cold-blooded, and infinitely dangerous conspiracy.<br> <br><b>"Peter May is a writer I'd follow to the ends of the earth." --Marilyn Stasio, <i>New York Times</i></b></p><p><b>Peter May</b> has written several standalone novels and three series: the award-winning China Thrillers, featuring Beijing detective Li Yan and American forensic pathologist Margaret Campbell; the critically acclaimed Enzo Files, featuring Scottish forensic scientist Enzo Macleod, set in France; and the Lewis Trilogy (<i>The Black House, The Lewis Man, </i>and <i>The Chessmen</i>), all three volumes of which are internationally bestselling novels.<br><br>One of Scotland's most prolific television dramatists, May garnered more than 1,000 credits over a decade and a half spent as scriptwriter and editor on prime-time British television.

Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.</p><p>"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life," writes Malcolm Gladwell, "is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do." Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's <i>The Tipping Point</i> has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.<p> For example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a "Connector": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere "wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston," he was also a "Maven" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.</p><p> Gladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the "stickiness" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of <i>Sesame Street</i> and <i>Blue's Clues</i>, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, <i>The Tipping Point</i> is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that "tipping point," like "future shock" or "chaos theory," will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><br><br>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>The Tipping Point,</i> <i>Blink, Outliers,</i> <i>What the Dog Saw,</i> and <i>David and Goliath.</i> He is also the co-founder of Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that produces the podcasts <i>Revisionist History</i>, which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood, and <i>Broken Record, </i>where he, Rick Rubin, and Bruce Headlam interview musicians across a wide range of genres. Gladwell has been included in the <i>Time</i> 100 Most Influential People list and touted as one of <i>Foreign Policy</i>'s<i> </i>Top Global Thinkers.</p><h2>Choosing &amp; Using Hand Tools</h2><p>&#x201c;Offers a wealth of information about the selection, care, and use of nearly every kind of hand tool...each entry is profusely illustrated with color photos...will prove to be a valuable resource.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>. &#x201c;If you are a decent woodworker this book is concentrated fun.

When the hospital was forced to close the children that had survived were taken to the death-camps. Blady-Szwajger became a reluctant courier for the resistance. She left the ghetto and began to carry paper money pinned into her clothing to those in hiding. She and her flat-mate pretended to be good-time girls having fun and threw parties to disguise the coming and going of their male visitors. This heroic memoir pays tribute to all the men and women who paid with their lives for the safety of others.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: PolishIn the literature of the Holocaust, this journal is among the most memorable, haunting and elegantly crafted, as, from her hospital bed in today's Warsaw, Szwajger, a pediatrician, a Polish Jew born in 1917, dredges into her memory of the events that followed the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact in 1939. Her portraits of children suffering the brutality of war are particularly wrenching. Szwajger recalls a children's hospital at which she worked as a medical student with a prized "ticket" to travel between the Warsaw ghetto and the "Aryan side." We're shown the youngsters, starving, four to a bed; we feel Szwajger's anguish when the hospital is disbanded and she spares her patients their even crueler fate by administering overdoses of morphine to them. She sears us again at a monastery's children's center, describing its violent closure by the Nazis who hung the slaughtered priests on display. With false identity papers, Szwajger, a "courier girl" for the Jewish Fighting Organization, journeys throughout Poland carrying money to Jews and finding safe houses for them. Her husband is sent to a camp; she escapes a massacre at a Home Army hideout. Then, telling us about another act of euthanasia she committed, she decries: "I don't want to write any more. Not a sentence more. About anything." But it is enough, for Szwajger's testimony makes its impress as a classic.

He looks like he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of tar. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for some time, but Reverend Green&#x2019;s still writing. His quill runs across the paper, scratching like mouse paws. Scratch scratch, dip, scratch, lick, scratch.</p><p>My feet ache, and shifting my weight just makes the one hurt worse than the other. I&#x2019;m leaning in the door frame, and in my mind my mother prods me in my back to make me straight. It&#x2019;s so sharp, the prodding, I could almost swear she was really there.</p><p>&#x201c;Ann?&#x201d; he says.</p><p>I&#x2019;d gotten so used to the waiting that I don&#x2019;t hear him at first. </p><p>&#x201c;Ann!&#x201d; He&#x2019;s tossed his quill down.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I whisper.</p><p>He turns a chill eye on me, an arm over the back of his chair. His elbow&#x2019;s worn the turkey-work well away, &#x2019;til it&#x2019;s so threadbare, it shines. Reverend Green&#x2019;s the kind of man who&#x2019;s always being interrupted. A harassed look about him, as if he can never get time to concentrate on one thing altogether. Spends his whole life turning around in his chair.</p><p>I take a step back, thinking better of my errand. He gives me a long look. He&#x2019;s none too eager to hear what I&#x2019;ve got to say either.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;d best come in,&#x201d; he says at length, returning to his paper. </p><p>He hunches over his desk, free hand clutching bunches of his hair<br>like he&#x2019;s anxious to finish whatever he&#x2019;s writing. Scratch scratch scratch.</p><p>I should&#x2019;ve gone when I had the chance; he&#x2019;d never&#x2019;ve known I was here. I glance over my shoulder, through the parsonage hall. Goody Green, his wife, has got the fire going all right, but the door&#x2019;s open to the yard, as it&#x2019;s a warm day. The patch of sunlight on the floor is so bright, I have to squint. A long stretch of shadow, and a cat wraps around the doorjamb and flattens himself out in the sunshine with a yawn. He rolls on his back, batting at ghosts.</p><p>Goody Green&#x2019;s at the table wringing out cheesecloth. She looks harried, and no wonder, with the baby hiccoughing so. She was bouncing him up and down the hall when I arrived, beating him over her shoulder. I said she should hold him upside down and give him a little shake, but she glared and said, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll just wait for Reverend Green over there.&#x201d;</p><p>I not being a mother, I suppose she&#x2019;d ignore my advice, though it&#x2019;s common knowledge how many Putnams I raised myself. Now I see she&#x2019;s given up. The baby&#x2019;s stashed in a long wooden cradle near enough that she can rock it with a foot, but she&#x2019;s just letting him cough, all red in the face like a baked apple. And to be sure she can&#x2019;t call on anyone for so much as a poultice.</p><p>No one can, in the village, anymore.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on, then,&#x201d; she says to me, giving the cloth a final twist. She&#x2019;s got some arms, has Goody Reverend Green. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you keep him waiting.&#x201d; </p><p>If she weren&#x2019;t there, I could sneak away. I feel my heart pressing against my ribs, and the top of my head opening, as if my soul were being ripped from my body by the hair.</p><p>A girl in a dirty coif wanders in from the yard, finger in her mouth, her apron splotched with mud. She looks over at me all shy, because she doesn&#x2019;t know me, or perhaps because she&#x2019;s been warned to keep away. She&#x2019;s like a sweet piglet walking on two legs, with those pink cheeks all in mud like that, and I smile at her. She squeaks in terror and runs to hide behind her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Come now, Ann,&#x201d; the Reverend coaxes me from within his study. </p><p>It&#x2019;s cooler in there. It&#x2019;s away from the kitchen fire, with its window over the side yard, facing away from the sun. I&#x2019;d like to sit. My feet<br>are so tired.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of.&#x201d; </p><p>But there is.</p><p>There is everything to be afraid of.</p><p>I swallow the lead ball in my throat that no amount of swallowing can be rid of, and move into the shadows of the Reverend&#x2019;s study. There&#x2019;s a bench between his desk and the fireplace. It&#x2019;s as hard as a church pew. I could swear the back isn&#x2019;t so much straight as curved, to force my head to bow. But it&#x2019;s not the bench that&#x2019;s making me hang my head.</p><p>The Reverend gingerly sands his paper, blows it clean, and blots, holding the paper to the light to approve of his work. Satisfied, he turns at last to me.</p><p>But when his eyes fall on my face, he recoils, as if I&#x2019;d moved to strike him.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve come to Reverend Green to make my confession.<br></p><p> <br><br>Part 1</p><p><br><b>JANUARY</b><br><br>Y U LE T I D E<br>And it was at Jerusalem</p><p>the feast of the dedication,</p><p>and it was winter.<br><br>JOHN 10:22<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p><br>DANVERS, MASSACHUSETTS <br><br>WEDNESDAY, JANUAR Y 11, 2012<br>The truth is, I&#x2019;m not sure when it started. I don&#x2019;t actually think anybody really knows.</p><p>For a while figuring out the very first instance of it seemed really important. They were interviewing all of us because they wanted to find the locus of it, or whatever, I don&#x2019;t really know. They marched us into the office one at a time, and there was this big map of the school up on a wall. It was covered in pins with little flags, each one with a date. It was super complicated. I think they thought that with enough pins and flags and yarn and everything, they&#x2019;d figure it out, or at least it would look really impressive for the news cameras. And don&#x2019;t get me wrong, it was impressive. All those arrows and everything looked wicked complicated. It didn&#x2019;t help them figure anything out, though. I think it just made them feel better.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.</p><p>If I was really forced to pick a date, like at gunpoint, I&#x2019;d have to go with January 11. I&#x2019;m saying that only because it was just a completely basic Wednesday with nothing much to recommend it.</p><p>Exactly the kind of day I shouldn&#x2019;t remember.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been back from winter break only a couple of days, but we&#x2019;d already gotten into the routine. Senior year. Last semester. We were pretty keyed up. I mean, everybody&#x2019;s always on edge when the semester starts, kind of, except spring semester senior year is like that normal nervousness times a million. Senior year is when it all comes together, all the years of studying and work and projects and sports and campaigns and whatever we&#x2019;re into that we&#x2019;ve been working really hard for&#x2014;it&#x2019;s either about to pay off or everything is about to completely fall apart. And don&#x2019;t even get me started about waiting for college acceptance letters. But even though senior year is massive, is basically the moment that sets up the rest of our entire lives and whether we&#x2019;re going to be successful and get everything we want or whether we&#x2019;re going to die alone in a ditch in the snow, we still have to get up and make it through every day. I still get up and brush my teeth, right?</p><p>This Wednesday should have been the most generic Wednesday imaginable, even if it was a Wednesday of the spring semester of our last year at St. Joan&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit,&#x201d; my mother said.</p><p>I was standing by the kitchen sink shoving a cranberry muffin into my mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I said, plucking at my shirt to shake the crumbs out the bottom.</p><p>&#x201c;Colleen, for God&#x2019;s sake. You won&#x2019;t be able to digest anything. Would you sit down for five minutes?&#x201d; Mom used the toe of her slipper to brush the crumbs under the edge of the dishwasher.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve got to go,&#x201d; I insisted as Dad came up behind us, rattling the car keys.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get the problem set done?&#x201d; Mom asked. She licked her thumb to rub crumbs from the corner of my mouth, and I squirmed away from her.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom! Get over it! Yes, I got the problem set done.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You want me to look it over real quick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Linda,&#x201d; my dad warned from the front door. He jingled the keys again, and I slung up my backpack and kissed Mom on the cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>Could there be a more normal Wednesday morning? It&#x2019;s so normal, I almost want to embellish it, and add something kind of exciting or dramatic or interesting. But I just can&#x2019;t, because nothing like that happened. Dad dropped me off at school, and the upper school hallway was awash like it always was in an ocean of girls in plaid skirts and cardigans and wool tights and Coach handbags from the outlet store. I knew most of them, at least well enough to say hello, though every class adds a lot of new girls freshman year and so the older we got, the more strangers started peppering the hallways.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Colleen,&#x201d; said someone in passing, I didn&#x2019;t see who, but I said &#x201c;Hey&#x201d; back and nodded to be nice. I stopped by my locker to swap out some books and scroll through a few texts that didn&#x2019;t seem very important. I was just replying to something, I don&#x2019;t remember what, when I heard it.</p><p>&#x201c;Colleeeen, I saw you standing alooooooone, without a dream in my heart . . . without a love of your own. Colleeeeeeeeeeen,&#x201d; a voice hummed from inside my advisory classroom.</p><p>I looked up and grinned at the spines of my textbooks. Deena was stuck on &#x201c;Blue Moon.&#x201d; Again.</p><p>Deena&#x2019;s the first one who&#x2019;s important to know about. She came to St. Joan&#x2019;s in sixth grade, and when she got here, she was the tallest one in the class, even taller than me, this string bean girl from Charleston with a shock of baby dreadlocks falling in layers to her shoulders. She had such a thick Southern accent that at first I kind of couldn&#x2019;t tell what she was saying. But she lost the y&#x2019;alls after only a couple of weeks, and then she started dropping her R&#x2019;s. That girl is a total language sponge. The craziest is when she speaks Japanese. I think she gets a special kick out of shocking people with it, especially when she was on her exchange program in Tokyo last summer&#x2014;a six-foot-tall African American girl speaking near-fluent Japanese after just three months.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said, sliding into my seat.</p><p>Deena grinned at me, spread her arms wide, and went for the big finish.</p><p>&#x201c;Collleeeeeeeen! You knew just what I was there for, you heard me saying a prayer for, someone I really could care for!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s already been at this for, like, ten minutes,&#x201d; Emma whispered to me, loudly enough that Deena could hear her.</p><p>Emma. Nominally, Emma is my best friend. I don&#x2019;t even remember when I first met her, but we were tiny. Before preschool. She&#x2019;s from Danvers, her parents are from Danvers, her grandparents were all from Danvers, her whole family lives in Danvers. Her brother, Mark, went to Endicott in Beverly because he didn&#x2019;t want to be too far from Danvers. They all look alike, too, all the Blackburns. And they&#x2019;re really clannish. Emma&#x2019;s mom is one of those delicate blondes who is usually shuttered away with a headache, and when that happens, we can&#x2019;t go over to the Blackburns&#x2019; house. They&#x2019;re all very protective of each other. If somebody mentions, as I made the mistake of doing once, that maybe Emma&#x2019;s mom would feel better if she just went outside once in a while, Emma will cut them dead with a look and say, &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma has always had a quietness to her, which is one of the reasons I like her so much. But it can also make her hard to read. Her reserve is a complete inversion of the chaos of my house. Emma was the last one of us to play with dolls&#x2014;she was thirteen, which is kind of crazy, and we&#x2019;d all already gotten our periods and were starting to text boys, but she&#x2019;d still ask shyly if I wanted to bring my American Girl doll when I came over. They&#x2019;re still out in her room, and I sometimes imagine her whispering to them when the lights go out. She has buttery-blond hair, which in the summers turns almost white in the sun. Her eyebrows are so light and pale, they almost don&#x2019;t exist, and she refuses to wear makeup at all, which gives Emma a naked, otherworldly look.</p><p>Once it was clear that I liked Deena, Emma decided she was okay, too. It was Emma who taught Deena to stop saying &#x201c;milk shake&#x201d; when she meant &#x201c;frappe.&#x201d;</p><p>Deena&#x2019;s elbow was taking up so much room that Fabiana had to squeeze herself around the desk to sit down next to her. Fabiana, I don&#x2019;t know as well. She came to St. Joan&#x2019;s as a freshman, part of that influx of new people when we got to upper school. She&#x2019;s okay. Kind of annoying. I didn&#x2019;t like to give much of myself away to Fabiana. It&#x2019;s not that I didn&#x2019;t like her, it&#x2019;s just that we were applying a lot of the same places, and we were sort of in competition for grades, even though it was spring semester.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know why I just said &#x201c;sort of &#x201d; when I don&#x2019;t mean that at all. Fabiana and I were competing for valedictorian. I know it&#x2019;s not cool to seem like I care that much, and I wasn&#x2019;t really supposed to make it look like I was trying hard to get the grades I was getting, but the truth is, I was having a hard time with it. For all of high school I&#x2019;d been able to hold everyone else off without any trouble, and keep up the fiction that I didn&#x2019;t have to work hard at it, and I didn&#x2019;t really care. But the truth is, I cared. I cared a lot. And so did Fabiana. She watched me as coolly as I watched her.</p><p>Fabiana sat near us, but she wasn&#x2019;t part of our group. We&#x2019;re not supposed to have cliques at St. Joan&#x2019;s, but honestly, good luck with keeping teenage girls from forming cliques. It&#x2019;s not like we all had matching satin bomber jackets with our cutesy nicknames on the back. But Deena, Emma, and I were a clique, and the fourth member was Anjali. So Anjali was there already, too, and she&#x2019;d been talking the whole time, pausing just long enough to give me a wave hello. I could tell we were all alive and breathing because Anjali was talking about Yale. It was the surest way to start a morning off right.</p><p>&#x201c;Like in that movie, where he&#x2019;s, like, a crew guy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Skulls?&#x201d; someone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They are totally not like that at all, though I&#x2019;ve heard that the inside is actually really that nice. It&#x2019;s all crazy old, with portraits and everything. I heard that George Bush&#x2019;s family gave them like a million dollars to redo the parlor after he trashed it at some party back in the sixties.&#x201d;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t sure whom Anjali was talking to. Emma? I glanced at her. </p><p>Maybe, on a technicality, but Emma was only half listening. Deena was too involved to care, and anyway this was all old territory. </p><p>&#x201c;Secret societies, you know,&#x201d; Emma explained in a whisper. </p><p>So she had been listening. Emma misses nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, they don&#x2019;t, like, give everybody cars like that. That&#x2019;s totally not true,&#x201d; Anjali continued, not seeming to care if anyone was listening or not.</p><p>Sometimes I felt a little sorry for Anjali. She had come to St. Joan&#x2019;s the previous year because her mom got a job at Mass General. They lived a bunch of places before that&#x2014;Houston, Chicago, I forget where else. Her mom is a big deal medical researcher, and her dad&#x2019;s a lawyer, the kind who wears a gigantic watch and leaves papers all over the dining table so no one can ever eat there. They are really, really intense. Anjali fell in with us right away, because she&#x2019;s completely fun and hilarious and smart, but I&#x2019;ve seen her in tears over an A-minus&#x2014; on a physics problem set, thanks very much, not even a final.</p><p>&#x201c;They give you c...</p></p><h2>Science Detective� Beginning</h2><p>(Grades 3-4) Science Detective� uses topics and skills drawn from national science standards to prepare students for more advanced science courses and new assessments that measure reasoning, reading comprehension, and writing in science.

National standards and local favorites are included. The music derives from New England, Irish, Scottish, Quebecois, Appalachian, and English sources, all of which are included in the book. Chord suggestions are provided. There is an extensive commentary on each tune. Discography, bibliography, indices, and more are included. <p>Since it's publication in 1997, <i>The Portland Collection</i> has become the standard for contra dance musicians all across the United States and has also become popular among fiddlers of many other genres. The book is praised for its clear, readable format; its sturdy covers and binding; its informative, entertaining commentary; and especially for the repertoire itself. This music is suitable for any acoustic instrument. Beginners and accomplished musicians alike will find tunes that match their skill levels in this book. </p><p>There are two companion recordings for this book. On <i>A Portland Selection 2</i> editors Susan Songer and Clyde Curley, joined by fiddler George Penk, play a representative cross section of the music in the book using a variety of tempos, harmonies, and other variations on the music. <i>A Portland Play Along Selection</i> is a 2-disc album of 97 tunes from both of the <i>Portland Collection</i> books engineered for ease of playing along. Fiddler Betsy Branch joins Clyde and Susan on this recording. Both of these recordings are for sale elsewhere on Amazon.com.</p></p><p>Susan Songer, of Portland Oregon, has enjoyed music as long as she can remember. In grade school, she played piano and eagerly participated in square dancing during P.E. classes. She played folk songs on guitar with informal groups during and just after college. Susan has been an avid contra dancer since 1986, and a dance pianist and fiddler since 1992. She is a member of the Portland-based contra dance bands Joyride and Calico, and also plays piano (both contra and English) coast to coast for many other fiddlers and their bands. She has tutored both beginning fiddlers and piano players at The Festival of American Fiddle Tunes and also plays contra dance week end and week-long camps. Susan is founder and director of the 75-member Portland Megaband, which plays for a very large, special dance once a year. In her other life, Susan has been first a middle school teacher and then a psychologist with a private practice. Music eventually overtook these more traditional day jobs, and she retired from psychology in order to focus on contra dance music publication and playing. <p>Clyde Curley got his first guitar in 1959 when he was in 9th grade. He has been playing folk music ever since on an increasing arsenal of instruments. Seeing Doc Watson at a San Francisco State folk festival and hearing the records of the New Lost City Ramblers in the 60 s were serious formative moments. He moved to Oregon in 1970 to begin a 31-year career teaching high school English and raise a family and to play in a variety of bands specializing in several musical styles. Clyde has extensive experience as a musician and teacher at contra dance camps and music festivals up and down the West Coast. In Portland he played mandolin and banjo with the contra dance band Jigsaw and appeared on several recordings. Now in retirement from teaching, he lives in Bellingham, Washington, where he continues to play for dances and plumb the secrets of old-time fiddling. Clyde also writes occasional articles for Strings magazine and is currently teaching himself to write fiction by hacking away at a murder mystery set in Portland.</p>"Most folks interested in contra dance music or fiddling in general know The Portland Collection, a wonderful tune book." -- <i>Bruce E Baker, Dirty Linen, Feb/Mar 02</i><br><br>"This is an important piece of work...one of the best throughout collections to come across this desk..." -- <i>Bob Buckingham, Fiddler Magazine, Spring, 1999</i><br><br>"an impressive and welcome tome...clear and clean transcriptions, enjoyable commentaries on each piece." -- <i>Kerry Blech, victory Review, September, 1997</i><br><br>"Most folks interested in contra dance music or fiddling in general know The Portland Collection, a wonderful tune book." -- <i>Bruce E Baker, Dirty Linen, Feb/Mar 02</i><br><br>"This is an important piece of work...one of the best throughout collections to come across this desk..." -- <i>Bob Buckingham, Fiddler Magazine, Spring, 1999</i><br><br>"an impressive and welcome tome...clear and clean transcriptions, enjoyable commentaries on each piece." --<i>Kerry Blech, victory Review, September, 1997</i></p><h2>Where Chefs Eat: A Guide to Chefs&#39; Favorite Restaurants (2015)</h2><p><p><b>The completely revised new edition of the best&#x2010;selling restaurant guidebook, which sold over 100,000 copies.</b></p><p>This is the ultimate restaurant guide written by the real experts: more than 600 of the world&#x2019;s best chefs, including recommendations from René Redzepi, David Chang, Jason Atherton, Shannon Bennett, Helena Rizzo, Massimo Bottura, Yotam Ottolenghi, Yoshihiro Narisawa and hundreds more.

This book is that story."<br>-- From the Preface by Danyel Smith, editor-in-chief of VIBE, the voice of the hip hop generation, presents the essence of hip hop.</p><p>In his introduction, founding <i>Vibe</i> editor Alan Light justifies the magazine's 300-page hip-hop chronicle in historical terms, noting that while less than 15 years passed between Elvis's first single and Woodstock, it's been two full decades since rap busted out of New York City street parties via the Sugar Hill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." It's a righteous point, and the multi-author <i>Vibe History</i> indeed deserves to be filed next to <i>The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll</i>. Like that book, <i>Vibe</i>'s serves both as a fact-heavy primer and a passionate critical missive aimed straight for fans' hearts. Here we find all the contradictions of a pop-culture phenomenon: art and a hope for immortality rolled into a brightly colored form whose practitioners, even the most politically driven, demand to <i>get paid</i>. Or, as Charles Aaron writes in his essay on KRS-One, the rapper "has never failed to passionately contradict himself--footnotes, bibliography, and dope beats included." Those contradictions may not make the culture go, but as with rock's, they help make it both more frustrating and more fascinating. Whether reminiscing about the future shock of first hearing Run-D.M.C.'s "Sucker M.C.'s," gnawing at the tragic knots at the heart of Tupac Shakur's story, or celebrating women rappers, hip-hop movies, and dancehall reggae, these chapters do what the best music writing should--educate, excite, and lead the reader to the record racks. <i>--Rickey Wright</i>Includes FREE 4-song CD with a new, unreleased Run-DMC track from their forthcoming album, Crown Royal, as well as classic songs by other artists from the new CD Profilin': The Hits.<br><br>Music, fashion, dance, graffiti, movies, videos, and business: it's all in this brilliant tale of a cultural revolution that spans race and gender, language and nationality.

Wall has created a unique, seductive and complex pictorial universe by drawing upon philosophy, literature, nineteenth-century painting, Neo-Realist cinema and the traditions of both Conceptual art and documentary photography. Organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Wall's 2007 American traveling retrospective will include all of the artist's major works to date. In addition to color plates and illuminating details, the exhibition catalogue includes an essay by Peter Galassi that explores the full range of Wall's artistic and intellectual interests and offers fresh perspectives on one of the most adventurous creative achievements of our time. The essay is followed by an interview with the artist by James Rondeau, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, where the exhibition will be on view during the Summer of 2007. Also available from The Museum of Modern Art, New York: <i>Jeff Wall: Selected Essays and Interviews</i>.</p><p>Thierry de Duve has written extensively on modern and contemporary art, with an emphasis on the work of Marcel Duchamp and its legacy. A regular contributor to the journal October, he is editor of The Definitively Unfinished Marcel Duchamp (1991) and the author of Kant after Duchamp (1995). He has taught in the US and France, and lives and works between Belgium and France. Jean-Francois Chevrier is Professor of Contemporary Art History at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. He has curated numerous exhibitions including: &#39;Another Objectivity&#39; (with James Lingwood) (1989), &#39;Photokunst&#39; (1989), &#39;Walker Evans and Dan Graham&#39; (1992-1994) and &#39;Oyvind Fahlstroem&#39;, Barcelona (2001). He was also Curatorial Consultant for Documenta X in 1997. Arielle Pelenc is an art critic and curator who lives and works in France. She has written for Artefactum, Art Press, Parkett and Arts Magazine. Boris Groys was born in East Berlin and studied at Leningrad University. He emigrated to West Germany in 1981 and continues to work in Germany as a freelance author and critic. He has held senior academic posts at universities in Germany, Russia and the United Sates. He has been a contributor to Art in America and his books include The Total Art of Stalinism: Avant-garde, Aesthetic Dictatorship and Beyond (1992).There are a number of living artists whose reputations are solid but whose work is sadly unknown outside the art world. Fortunately, the "Contemporary Artists" series will go far to correct that. Affordable, thoroughly illustrated in color, these books provide maximum exposure for the price. Although this is enough to make the series worthy of consideration, it is important to point out what makes it unique. Each volume includes writings by the artists whenever possible. Of the two considered here, painter/printmaker Spero and photographer Wall, the latter is the more verbally prolific. In addition, a piece of literature was preselected by the artist to use as a tool for discussion. Put this together with essays by curators and critics, interviews from throughout the artist's career, and a handy chronology and you get an interesting, overall view of the artist. This multifaceted approach is rewarding not only for its comprehensive view of each individual artist but also because it allows each book in the series to vary according to its subject's strengths.

He had no claim to it but the belief that his father was a weak ruler and that he would be stronger. And so he took the throne by force. In a single night of bloodshed the Sultan and the prince&#x2019;s brothers fell to the young prince&#x2019;s sword and the foreign army he led. When dawn came he was nolonger a prince. He was the Sultan.<br><br>The young Sultan was known to take wives into his harem the same way he had his country: by force.<br><br>In the first year of his rule, two such wives gave birth to sons under the same stars. One wife was a girl born in the sands. Her son belonged to the desert. The other wife was a girl born across the water, in a kingdom called Xicha, and raised on the deck of a ship. Her son did not belong.<br><br>But the sons grew as brothers nonetheless, their mothers shielding them from the things the palace walls could not. And for a time, in the Sultan&#x2019;s harem, things were well.<br><br>Until the first wife gave birth again, but this time to a child that was not her husband&#x2019;s&#x2014;a Djinni&#x2019;s daughter, with unnatural hair and unnatural fire in her blood. For her crime in betraying him, the Sultan turned his anger on his wife. She died under the force of his blows.<br><br>Such was his rage, the Sultan never noticed the second wife, who fled with their two sons and the Djinni&#x2019;s daughter, escaping back across the sea to the kingdom of Xicha, where she had been stolen from. There, her son, the Foreign Prince, could pretend that he belonged. The Desert Prince could not pretend; he was as foreign in this land as his brother had been in their father&#x2019;s. But neither prince was destined to stay long. Soon, both left Xicha for the open seas instead.<br><br>And for a time, on ships going anywhere and coming from nowhere, things were well for the brothers. They drifted from one foreign shore to another, belonging in each place equally.<br><br>Until one day, across the bow of the ship, Miraji appeared again.<br><br>The Desert Prince saw his country and remembered where he really belonged. On that familiar shore he left the ship and his brother. Though the Desert Prince asked his brother to join him, the Foreign Prince would not. His father&#x2019;s lands looked empty and barren to him and he could not understand what hold they had over his brother. And so they parted ways. The Foreign Prince stayed on the sea for a time, raging silently that his brother had chosen the desert over the sea.<br><br>Finally the day came when the Foreign Prince could no longer be separated from his brother. When he returned to the desert of Miraji, he found that his brother had set it on fire with rebellion. The Desert Prince talked of great things, of great ideas, of equality and of prosperity. He was surrounded by new brothers and sisters who loved the desert as he did. He was now known as the Rebel Prince. But still he welcomed the man who had been his brother his whole life with open arms.<br><br>And for a time things were well in the Rebellion.<br><br>Until there was a girl. A girl called the Blue-Eyed Bandit, who had been made in the sands and sharpened by the desert and who burned with all of its fire. And for the first time the Foreign Prince understood what it was that his brother loved in this desert.<br><br>The Foreign Prince and the Blue-Eyed Bandit crossed the sands together, all the way to a great battle in the city of Fahali, where the Sultan&#x2019;s foreign allies had rooted themselves.<br><br>In that battle of Fahali the rebels won their first great victory. They defended the desert against the Sultan who would have burned it alive. They freed the Demdji, another Djinni's child, whom the Sultan would have turned into a weapon against his will. They killed the young commander, their brother who would have shed blood until he could win praise from his father, the Sultan. They ruptured the Sultan&#x2019;s alliance with the foreigners who had been punishing the desert for decades. And the rebels claimed part of the desert for themselves.<br><br>The story of the battle of Fahali spread quickly. And with it spread news that the desert might be a prize for the taking again. For the desert of Miraji was the only place where the old magic and the new machines were able to exist together. The only country that could spit out guns quickly enough to arm men to fight in the great war raging between the nations of the north.<br><br>New eyes from foreign shores turned to Miraji, hungry ones. More foreign armies descended on the desert, coming from all sides, each trying to claim a new alliance, or the country itself. And while enemies from outside gnawed at the Sultan&#x2019;s borders and kept his army occupied, the rebels seized city after city from the inside, knocking them out of the Sultan&#x2019;s hands and rallying the people to their side.<br><br>And for a time things were well for the Rebellion, for the Blue-Eyed Bandit, and for the Foreign Prince. <br><br>Until the balance started to shift against the Rebel Prince. Two dozen rebels were lost in a trap set for them in the sands, where they were surrounded and outgunned. A city rose up against the Sultan, crying out the Rebel Prince&#x2019;s name in the night. But those who did saw the next dawn with the blank eyes of the dead. And the Blue-Eyed Bandit fell to a bullet in a battle in the mountains, gravely wounded and only just clinging to life. There, for the firsttime since the threads of their stories had become tangled, the Blue-Eyed Bandit&#x2019;s and the Foreign Prince&#x2019;s paths split.<br><br>While the Blue-Eyed Bandit clung to her life, the Foreign Prince was sent to the eastern border of the desert. There, an army from Xicha was camped. The Foreign Prince stole a uniform and walked into the Xichian camp as if he belonged. It was easy there, where he did not look foreign anymore. He stood with them as they battled the Sultan&#x2019;s forces, spying in secret for the Rebel Prince.<br><br>And for a time things were well, hiding among the foreign army.<br><br>Until the missive came from the enemy camp, its bearer wearing the Sultan&#x2019;s gold and white and holding up a flag of peace.<br><br>The Foreign Prince would have killed for news of what came in that missive for his own side, but there was no need. It was known that he spoke the desert language. He was summoned into the Xichian general&#x2019;s tent to translate between the Sultan&#x2019;s envoy and the Xichian, neither of them knowing he was an enemy of them both. As hetranslated he learned that the Sultan was calling for a ceasefire. He was tired of bloodshed, the message said. He was ready to negotiate. The Foreign Prince learned that the ruler of Miraji was summoning all the foreign rulers to him to talk of a new alliance. The Sultan asked for any king or queen or emperor or prince who would lay claim to his desert to come to his palace to make their case.<br><br>The missive went to the Xichian emperor the next morning. And the guns stopped. The ceasefire had started. Next would come negotiations. Then peace between the Sultan and the invaders. And without the need to mind his shores, the desert ruler&#x2019;s eyes would turn inward again.<br><br>The Foreign Prince understood it was time to return to his brother. Their rebellion was about to turn into a war.<br><b>Two</b><br><br>I&#x2019;d always liked this shirt. It was a shame about all the blood.<br><br>Most of it wasn&#x2019;t mine, at least. The shirt wasn&#x2019;t mine, either, for that matter&#x2014;I&#x2019;d borrowed it from Shazad and never bothered to give it back. Well, she probably wouldn&#x2019;t want it now.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d;<br><br>I was jerked to a halt. My hands were tied, and the rope chafed painfully along the raw skin of my wrists. I hissed a curse under my breath as I tilted my head back, finally looking up from my dusty boots to lock eyes with the glare of the desert sun.<br><br>The walls of Saramotai cast a mighty long shadow in the last of the light. <br><br>These walls were legendary. They had stood indifferent to one of the greatest battles of the First War, between the hero Attallah and the Destroyer of Worlds. They were so ancient they looked like they&#x2019;d been built out of the bones of the desert itself. But the words slapped in sloppy white paint above the gates . . . those were new.<br><br>Welcome to the Free City<br><br>I could see where the paint had dripped between the cracks in the ancient stones before drying in the heat.<br><br>I had a few things to say about being dragged to a so-called Free City tied up like a goat on a spit, but even I knew I was better off not running my mouth just now.<br><br>&#x201c;Declare yourself or I&#x2019;ll shoot!&#x201d; someone called from the city wall. The words were a whole lot more impressive than the voice that came with them. I could hear the crack of youth on that last word. I squinted up through my sheema at the kid pointing a rifle at me from the top of the walls. He couldn&#x2019;t have been any older than thirteen. He was all limbs and joints. He didn&#x2019;t look like he could&#x2019;ve held that gun right if his life depended on it. Which it probably did. This being Miraji and all.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s us, Ikar, you little idiot,&#x201d; the man holding me bellowed in my ear. I winced. Shouting really didn&#x2019;t seem necessary. &#x201c;Now, open the gates right now or, God help me, I&#x2019;m going to have your father beat you harder than one of his horseshoes until some brains go in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hossam?&#x201d; Ikar didn&#x2019;t lower the gun right away. He was twitchy as all get-out. Which wasn&#x2019;t the best thing when he had one finger on the trigger of a rifle. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that with you?&#x201d; He waved his gun in my direction. I turned my body on instinct as the barrel swung wildly. He didn&#x2019;t look like he could hit the broad side of a barn if he was trying, but I wasn&#x2019;t ruling out that he might hit me by accident. If he did, better to get shot in the shoulder than the chest.<br><br>&#x201c;This&#x201d;&#x2014;a hint of pride crept into Hossam&#x2019;s voice as he jerked my face up to the sunlight like I was a hunted carcass&#x2014;&#x201c;is the Blue-Eyed Bandit.&#x201d;<br><br>That name landed with more weight than it used to, drawing silence down behind it. On top of the wall Ikar stared. Even this far away I saw his jaw open, going slack for a moment, then close. <br><br>"Open the gates!" Ikar squawked finally, scrambling down. &#x201c;Open the gates!&#x201d;<br><br>The huge iron doors swung open painfully slow, fighting against the sand that had built up over the day. Hossam and the other men with us jostled me forward in a hurry as the ancient hinges groaned.<br><br>The gates didn&#x2019;t open all the way, only enough for one man to get through at a time. Even after thousands of years those gates looked as strong as they had at the dawn of humanity. They were iron through and through, as thick as the span of a man&#x2019;s arms, and operated by some system of weights and gears that no other city had been able to duplicate. There&#x2019;d be no breaking these gates down. And everyone knew there was no climbing the walls of Saramotai.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seemed like the only way into the city these days was by being dragged through the gates as a prisoner with a hand around your neck. Lucky me.<br><br>Saramotai was west of the middle mountains. Which meant it was ours. Or at least, it was supposed to be. After the battle at Fahali, Ahmed had declared this territory his. Most cities had sworn their allegiance quickly enough, as the Gallan occupiers who&#x2019;d held this half of the desert for so long emptied out of the streets. Or we&#x2019;d claimed their allegiance away from the Sultan.<br><br>Saramotai was another story.<br><br><i>Welcome to the Free City.</i><br><br>Saramotai had declared its own laws, taking rebellion one step further.<br><br>Ahmed talked a whole lot about equality and wealth for the poor. The people of Saramotai had decided the only way to create equality was to strike down those who were above them. That the only way to become rich was to take their wealth. So they&#x2019;d turned against the rich under the guise of accepting Ahmed&#x2019;s rule.<br><br>But Ahmed knew a grab for power when he saw one. We didn&#x2019;t know all that much about Malik Al-Kizzam, the man who&#x2019;d taken over Saramotai, except that he&#x2019;d been a servant to the emir and now the emir was dead and Malik lived in his grand estate.<br><br>So we sent a few folks to find out more. And do something about it if we didn&#x2019;t like it.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t come back.<br><br>That was a problem. Another problem was getting in after them.<br><br>And so here I was, my hands tied so tight behind my back I was losing feeling in them and a fresh wound on my collarbone where a knife had just barely missed my neck. Funny how being successful felt exactly the same as getting captured.<br><br>Hossam shoved me ahead of him through the narrow gap in the gates. I stumbled and went sprawling in the sand face-first, my elbow bashing into the iron gate painfullyas I went down.<br><br>Son of a bitch, that hurt more than I thought it would.<br><br>A hiss of pain escaped through my teeth as I rolled over. Sand stuck to my hands where sweat had pooled under the ropes, clinging to my skin. Then Hossam grabbed me, yanking me to my feet. He hustled me inside, the gate clanging quickly shut behind us. It was almost like they were afraid of something.<br><br>A small crowd had already gathered inside the gate to gawk. Half were clutching guns. More than a few of those were pointed at me.<br><br>So my reputation really did precede me.<br><br>&#x201c;Hossam.&#x201d; Someone pushed to the front. He was older than my captors, with serious eyes that took in my sorry state. He looked at me more levelly than the others. He wouldn&#x2019;t be blinded by the same eagerness. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We caught her in the mountains,&#x201d; Hossam crowed. &#x201c;She tried to ambush us when we were on our way back from trading for the guns.&#x201d; Two of the other men with us dropped bags that were heavy with weapons on the ground proudly, as if to show off that I hadn&#x2019;t gotten in their way. The guns weren&#x2019;t of Mirajin make. Amonpourian. Stupid-looking things. Ornate and carved, made by hand instead of machine, and charged at twice what they were worth because someone had gone to the trouble of making them pretty. It didn&#x2019;t matter how pretty something was, it&#x2019;d kill you just as dead. That, I&#x2019;d learned from Shazad.<br><br>&#x201c;Just her?&#x201d; the man with the serious eyes asked. &#x201c;On her own?&#x201d; His gaze flicked to me. Like he might be able to suss out the truth just from looking at me. Whether a girl of seventeen would really think she could take on a half dozen grown men with nothing but a handful of bullets and win. Whether the famous Blue-Eyed Bandit could really be <i>that</i> stupid.<br><br>I preferred &#x201c;reckless.&#x201d;<br><br>But I kept my mouth shut. The more I talked, the more likely I was to say something that&#x2019;d backfire on me. <i>Stay silent, look sullen, try not to get yourself killed. </i><br><br><i>If all else fails, just stick with that last one.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Are you really the Blue-Eyed Bandit?&#x201d; Ikar blurted out, making everyone&#x2019;s head turn. He&#x2019;d scrambled down from his watchpost on the wall to come gawk at me with the rest. He leaned forward eagerly across the barrel of his gun. If it went off now it&#x2019;d take both his hands and part of his face with it. &#x201c;Is it true what they say about you?&#x201d;<br><br><i>Stay silent. Look sullen. Try not to get yourself killed.&nbsp;</i>&#x201c;Depends what they&#x2019;re saying, I suppose.&#x201d; Damn it. That didn&#x2019;t last so long. &#x201c;And you shouldn&#x2019;t hold your gun like that.&#x201d;<br>...</p><h2>We Were in Auschwitz</h2><p>SAME COVER AS STOCK PHOTO SHOWN. MINOR EDGE WEAR ON COVERS &amp; SPINE. NO FULL DUST JACKET ON BOOK, BUT A PORTION OF DUST JACKET HAS BEEN TAPED INSIDE FRONT COVER. OTHERWISE PAGES CLEAN AND IN NICE CONDITION.</p><p>The first translation of a confusing, erratic memoir of life in Auschwitz, collaboratively written by three Polish survivors.The authors offer a rarely seen view of life in Auschwitz. As political prisoners (rather than Jews), all three were able to manipulate the deadly bureaucracy in their favor. The first third of the book depicts their rise from laborers on the cusp of extermination to well-fed service providers within the camp. We are taught the difference between good and bad work units (kommandos), we witness the horrors of disease and medical treatment in the camps, and we are given a glimpse of the starvation-crazed nihilism that governed the existence of the prisoners. Arresting stuff, narrated with neither poetry nor insight, but effective enough. The three narrators, however, become something of a triple-headed beast for the reader. Only rarely (and even then only accidentally) is it clear which of the three is narrating. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that different voices are plainly at work, and these fluctuations become more noticeable as Siedlecki et al. find themselves in the somewhat safe positions of hospital orderly, nurse in training, and "Kanada" corps member (the group that determined whether new arrivals would be sent to the gas chambers or made to work). Without starvation, regular beatings, and the proximity of death, life in Auschwitz becomes banal-which is, in many ways, the most horrifying aspect of the story. As the smoke of burnt bodies clouds the air above, the authors were having sex with gypsy women, conducting petty arguments with SS officers, and conniving to increase their take of booty from the doomed prisoners. In a letter to a loved one, the days are even described as "delightful." Perhaps originally intended to document horror, the past 54 years have rendered Siedlecki et al. strange ghosts of an uncommon Auschwitz.An odd drop in the unfillable bucket of Holocaust memoirs. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The books under review represent both the earliest and most recent of Holocaust memoirs. We Were in Auschwitz was written by a trio of former inmates in 1945, the most famous of whom was Tadusz Borowski, author of This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen. The book gives an insightful depiction of camp life, in particular the use and meaning of such slang terms as "Canada" (which refers to "prosperity," or the looted wealth stored at Auschwitz). The brutality of daily life and the guilt of survival come through clearly. Published in Poland in 1946 and translated in its entirety for the first time, this book is a welcome addition to Holocaust literature. Conversely, Samson's memoir appears to have been written only recently. The author, her mother, and two siblings survived in hiding for three years with the help of a Christian family. (Samson now lives in Baltimore.) Her story gives important insight into the nature of Polish collaboration with the Nazis. Although her story is well written and deserves to be told, the subtitle, "A Child's View of the Holocaust," is inaccurate. Since the book is apparently not based on a diary or notes written at the time, it is really not a child's view but rather a recollection of her experiences. Although it might seem a trivial point, it is important to realize that little Holocaust literature actually speaks to us with a child's voice. Both books are recommended for public and academic libraries.DFrederic Krome, Jacob Rader Marcus Ctr. of the American Jewish Archives, Cincinnati <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jane and the Ghosts of Netley</h2><p>In her seventh captivating adventure, Jane Austen finds her crime-solving mettle put to the test in a confounding case of intrigue, murder, and high treason. Among the haunted ruins of an ancient abbey, Jane is drawn into a shadow world of dangerous secrets and traitorous hearts where not only her life is at stake--but the fate of England.<br><br><b>Jane and the Ghosts of Netley<br><br></b>As Jane Austen stands before the abandoned ruins of Netley Abbey, she imagines that ghosts really do haunt the centuries-old monastery. But the green-cloaked figure who startles her is all too human and he bears an unexpected missive from Lord Harold Trowbridge, one of the British government&#x2019;s most trusted advisers--and a man who holds a high place in Jane&#x2019;s life.Trowbridge tells Jane about a suspected traitor in their midst--and the disastrous consequences if she succeeds. But is Sophia Challoner, a beautiful widow with rumored ties to Emperor Bonaparte, really an agent of the enemy? <br><br>Dispatched to Netley Lodge, Jane sets about gaining the confidence of the mysterious and intriguing lady even as Trowbridge&#x2019;s grim prediction bears fruit: a British frigate is set afire and its shipwright found with his throat cut.It&#x2019;s clear that someone is waging a clandestine war of terror and murder. But before Jane can follow the trail of conspiracy to its source and unmask a calculating killer, the cold hand of murder will fall mercilessly yet again--and suddenly Jane may find herself dying for her country.<br><br>Elegantly intriguing, Jane and the Ghosts of Netley is a beautifully crafted novel of wit, character, and suspense that transports Jane and her many fans into a mystery of truly historical proportions--and a case that will test the amateur sleuth&#x2019;s true colors under fire.</p><p>Stephanie Barron, a lifelong admirer of Jane Austen&#x2019;s work, is the author of six previous Jane Austen mysteries. She lives in Colorado, where she is at work on the eighth Jane Austen mystery<b>, Jane and His Lordship&#x2019;s Legacy</b>.<b>Chapter 1<br><br>Bare Ruin'd Choirs<br>Tuesday, 25 October 1808<br>Castle Square, Southampton</b><br><br>There are few prospects so replete with romantic possibility--so entirely suited to a soul trembling in morbid awe--as the ruins of an English abbey. Picture, if you will, the tumbled stones where once a tonsured friar muttered matins; the echoing coruscation of the cloister, now opened to the sky; the soaring architraves of Gothick stone that oppress one's soul as with the weight of tombs. Vanished incense curling at the nostril--the haunting memory of chanted prayer, sonorous and unintelligible to an ear untrained in Latin--the ghostly tolling of a bell whose clapper is muted now forever! Oh, to walk in such a place under the chill of moonlight, of a summer evening, when the air off the Solent might stir the dead to speak! In such an hour I could imagine myself a heroine straight from Mrs. Radcliffe's pen: the white train of my gown sweeping over the ancient stones, my shadow but a wraith before me, and all the world suspended in silence between the storied past and the prosaic present.<br><br>Engaging as such visions must be, I have never ventured to Netley Abbey--for it is of Netley I would speak, it being the closest object to a romantic ruin we possess in Southampton--in anything but the broadest day. I am far too sensible a lady to linger in such a deserted place, with the darkling wood at my back and the sea to the fore, when the comfort of a home fire beckons. Thus we find the abyss that falls between the fancies of horrid novels, and the habits of those who read them.<br><br>"Aunt Jane!"<br><br>"Yes, George?" I glanced towards the bow, where my two nephews, George and Edward, surveyed the massive face of Netley Castle as it rose on the port side of the small skiff.<br><br>"Why do they call that place a castle, Aunt? It looks nothing like."<br><br>" 'Tis a Solent fort, you young nubbins," grunted Mr. Hawkins, our seafaring guide. "Built in King Henry's time, when the Abbey lands were taken. In a prime position for defending the Water, it is; they ought never to have spiked those guns."<br><br>"But we have Portsmouth at the Solent mouth, Mr. Hawkins," Edward observed, "and must trust to the entire force of the Navy to preserve us against the threat from France." The elder of the two boys--fourteen to George's thirteen--Edward prided himself on his cool intelligence. As my brother's heir, he was wont to assume the attitudes of a young man of fortune.<br><br>My nephews had come to me lately from Steventon, after a brief visit to my brother James--a visit that I am certain will live forever in their youthful memories as the most mournful of their experience. I say this without intending a slight upon the benevolence of my eldest brother, nor of his insipid and cheeseparing wife; for the tragedy that overtook our Edward and George was entirely due to Providence.<br><br>Nearly a fortnight has passed since a messenger out of Kent conveyed the dreadful intelligence: how Elizabeth Austen, the boys' mother and mistress of my brother Edward's fine estate at Godmersham, had retired after dinner only to fall dead of a sudden fit. Elizabeth! So elegant and charming, despite her numerous progeny; Elizabeth, unbowed as it seemed by the birth of her eleventh child in the last days of September. The surgeon could make nothing of the case; he declared it to be improbable; but dead our Lizzy was, despite the surgeon's protestations, and buried she has been a week since, in the small Norman church of St. Lawrence's where I attended her so often to Sunday service.<br><br>I suspect that too much breeding is at the heart of the trouble--but too much breeding is the lot of all women who marry young, particularly when they are so fortunate as to make a love-match. Elizabeth Bridges, third daughter of a baronet, was but eighteen when she wed, and only five-and-thirty when she passed from this life. With her strength of character, she ought to have lived to be eighty.<br><br>It remains, now, for the rest of us to comfort her bereaved family as best we may. My sister Cassandra, who went into Kent for Elizabeth's lying-in, shall remain at Godmersham throughout the winter. Dear Neddie bears the affliction with a mixture of Christian resignation and wild despair. My niece Fanny, who at fifteen is grown so much in form and substance as to seem almost another sister, must shoulder the burden of managing the younger children, for the household is without a governess. There is some talk of sending the little girls away to school, that they might not brood upon the loss of their mamma--but I cannot like the scheme, having nearly died when banished as a child to a young ladies' seminary. The elder boys, Edward and George, endured their visit to brother James at Steventon and appeared--chilled to the bone with riding next to Mr. Wise, the coachman--on Saturday. They are bound for their school in Winchester on the morrow.<br><br>Their happiness has been entirely in my keeping during this short sojourn in Southampton. I have embraced the duty with a will, for they are such taking lads, and the blight of grief sits heavily upon them. They forget their cares for a time in playing at spillikins, or fashioning paper boats to bombard with horse chestnuts. The evening hours, when dark descends and memory returns, are harder to sustain. George has proved a restless sleeper, crying aloud in a manner more suited to a child half his age. He will be roundly abused for weakness upon his return to school, if he does not take care.<br><br>My mother, I own, finds the boys' spirits to have a shattering effect upon her nerves, which invariably fail her in moments of family crisis. No matter how diligently Edward might twist himself about in our reading chairs, engrossed in The Lake of Killarney, or George lose a morning in attempting to sketch a ship of the line, their exuberance will drive my mother to her bedchamber well before the dinner hour, to take her evening meal upon a tray.<br><br>Yesterday, I carried the boys up the River Itchen in Mr. Hawkins's skiff, and stopped to examine a seventy-four that is presently building in the dockyard there.1 The place was a bustle of activity--scaffolding and labourers vied for place in a chaos of scrap wood and iron tools--and left to myself, I should not have dreamt of disturbing them. But under the chaperonage of Mr. Hawkins, a notorious tar known to all in Southampton as the Bosun's Mate, we received a ready welcome from the shipwright. Mr. Dixon is a hearty fellow of mature years and bright blue eyes who takes great pride in his work.<br><br>"Miss Austen, d'ye say?" he enquired sharply over our introduction. "Not any relation to Captain Francis Austen?"<br><br>"I am his sister, sir."<br><br>"Excellent fellow! A true fighting captain, or I miss my mark! And no blubberhead neither. You won't find Frank Austen playing cat-and-mouse with Boney; goes straight at 'em, in the manner of dear old Nelson."<br><br>"That is certainly my brother's philosophy. You are acquainted with him, I collect?"<br><br>"Supplied the Cap'n with carronades last summer, as he could not secure them in Portsmouth," Mr. Dixon replied. "He should certainly have need of them, once the St. Alban's reached the Peninsula. A great hand for gunnery, your brother. Now! What shall we find to engage the interest of these young scrubs, eh?"<br><br>He scrutinized my nephews' faces, well aware that nothing more was required to command their full attention than the spectacle of the seventy-four.<br><br>The great third-rate towered above our heads, her keel a massive construction of elm to which great ribs of oak were fixed. She was nearly complete, the decks having been laid and the hull partitioned into bulkheads, powder magazines, storerooms, and cabins, with ladders running up and down. The Itchen yard is ideally suited for such a ship, for the river water flows in through a lock, and the finished vessel may float down to Southampton Water in time.<br><br>"Jupiter!" Edward exclaimed. "Isn't she a beauty, though! How long have you been a-building?"<br><br>The shipwright gazed at his work with ill-concealed affection. "Nearly three years she's been under our hands, and you shall not find a sweeter ship in all the Kingdom. No rot in her timbers, no crank in her design; and we shan't hear of this lady falling to pieces in a storm!"<br><br>"Are such things so common?" I murmured to Mr. Hawkins.<br><br>The Bosun's Mate glowered. "Have ye not heard of the Forty Thieves, ma'am? All ships o' the line, built in rotten yards? Floating coffins, they were--though I served in no less than five of 'em."<br><br>"Good Lord."<br><br>"When is she to sail, Mr. Dixon?" George enquired.<br><br>"We expect to launch her at Spithead in the spring. Perhaps your naval uncle will have the command of her! Should you like to look in?"<br><br>"Should we!" the boy replied. "Above all things!"<br><br>"Jeremiah!" Dixon called. "Yo, there--Jeremiah! Now, where is that Lascar?"<br><br>A dark-skinned, lanky fellow with jet-black hair ran up and salaamed, in the manner of the East Indies. A Lascar! The boys, I am certain, had never encountered a true exotic of the naval world--one of the renowned sailors of the Seven Seas. I smiled to see Edward's expression of interest, and George's of apprehension.<br><br>"Jeremiah at your service," he said, with another low bow. "You wish to see the boat, yes?"<br><br>Mr. Dixon slapped my nephews on the back so firmly George winced. "Get along with ye, now. The Lascar won't bite. Refuses even to touch good English beef, if you'll credit it; but he's a dab hand with a plane and a saw."<br><br>Nearly an hour later we bid Mr. Dixon goodbye, and Mr. Hawkins turned his skiff towards home. Yesterday's water party proved so delightful, however--so exactly suited to my nephews' temperaments and interests--...</p><h2>A Comprehensive Guide to Wilderness &amp; Travel Medicine (Adventure Medical Kits)</h2><p>The Gear Aid First Aid Kit &amp; Wilderness Guide are important components of any emergency preparedness plan.

She and her husband divide their time between Santa Fe and Dallas.&nbsp;<i>Shadowheart</i>&nbsp;won the Romance Writers of America Rita Award for best long historical romance of 2004.

She was also Regency Historical Romance 2004 Career Achievement Award Winner from&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times Magazine</i>&nbsp;and the Innovative Historical Romance 1994 RRA Awards Nominee for Best Historical Romance Author.This long-awaited follow-up to Kinsale's last book, <i>For My Lady's Heart</i> (1993), takes place in 14th-century Europe, where Allegreto-assassin, pirate, brute and bastard son of the Navona family-attempts to reclaim his birthright in the Italian principality of Monteverde. To this end, he captures Elena, the princess of Monteverde, and makes her his wife in a particularly violent sex scene ("She met him with a fierce reply, opening her mouth against his shoulder, a willing she-cat to his leopard, biting him as viciously as if she could draw blood"). As Allegreto and Elena journey to Italy to face Franco Pietro, Elena's former fianc� and a rival of Allegreto's family, lust and affection spring between the two (in that order), but Elena's disdain for Allegreto's ability to murder without remorse gives rise to an abundance of romantic tension and some intense love scenes. Kinsale's characters speak in stilted phrases resembling Middle English, and she loads the book with historical detail, making it both realistic and ponderous. Those who have waited 11 years for Kinsale's return will lap up this romance, but others will be turned off by its length and its controlling, sometimes cruel, alpha male hero. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Degen's artwork is full of child appeal, whether he's picturing energetic Jesse skating, running, or flinging sprinkles in the air, or more quiet scenes of Jesse embraced by his parents.

In 1883, when he was just twenty-three, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> while he was living in Portsmouth and struggling to establish himself as both a doctor and a writer. He had already succeeded in having a number of short stories published in leading magazines of the day, such as <i>Blackwood&#x2019;s</i>, <i>All the Year Round</i>, <i>London Society</i>, and the <i>Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper</i>&#x2014;but as was the accepted practice of literary journals of the time, his stories had been published anonymously. Thus, Conan Doyle knew that in order to truly establish his name as a writer, he would have to write a novel. That novel&#x2014;the first he ever wrote and only now published for the first time&#x2014;is <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i>.&nbsp;Many of the themes and stylistic tropes of his later writing, including his first Sherlock Holmes story, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>&#x2014;published in 1887&#x2014;can be clearly seen. More a series of ruminations than a traditional novel, <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> is of considerable biographical importance and provides an exceptional window into the mind of the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Through John Smith, a fifty-year-old man confined to his room by an attack of gout, Conan Doyle sets down his thoughts and opinions on a range of subjects&#x2014;including literature, science, religion, war, and education&#x2014;with no detectable insecurity or diffidence. His writing is full of bravado.&nbsp;Though unfinished, <i>The Narrative of John Smith</i> stands as a fascinating record of the early work of a man on his way to being one of the best-known authors in the world. This book will be welcomed with enthusiasm by the numerous Conan Doyle devotees.&nbsp;<p></p></p><p><p>&nbsp;<b>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b> (1859 &#x2013;1930) was a British physician and writer, most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes. He was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays, romances, poetry, and nonfiction.</p>&#34;Someone, I think it was the noted Janeite Lord David Cecil, once said that Jane Austen was the kind of writer on whose laundry lists and notes to the milkman any keen reader would pounce. While Conan Doyle may not be considered to be in quite that category there can be no doubt that the heart of every lover of British writing will rejoice at this discovery of an early and as yet unpublished work by the creator of Holmes, Watson, Moriarty and Professor Challenger. The breadth, depth and scope of Conan Doyle&#39;s knowledge and curiosity is often overlooked. He was the first popular writer to tell the wider reading public about narcotics, the Ku Klux Klan, the mafia, the Mormons, American crime gangs, corrupt union bosses and much else besides. His boundless energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging mind, not to mention the pitch-perfect, muscular and memorable prose is all on display here in a work whose publication is very very welcome indeed.&#34;--Stephen Fry --Stephen Fry</p><h2>Trouble with Lichen</h2><p>The discovery of a method by which the human lifespan can be extended greatly leads to social turmoil.</p><p></p><h2>Secret Gospels: Essays on Thomas and the Secret Gospel of Mark</h2><p>Marvin Meyer is one of the leading experts on the secret gospels Gospel of Thomas, Secret Gospel of Mark, and others who has changed forever how we read the canonical gospels and understand early Christianity. In this new collection of his work, Meyer looks at these revolutionary texts in original and illuminating ways. He writes, for example, about the naked youths in the villa of the Mysteries. On the walls of a villa in Pompeii, a famous mural depicts a naked male reading from a scroll, a look of wonder on his face. A naked youth again appears in the Gospel of Mark, abandoning his garment and fleeing naked when apprehended during Jesus&#39; arrest. A similar youth appears in the Secret Gospel of Mark. These youths, Meyer proposes, serve as an image of religious initiation, candidates for the mysteries of Dionysus or of Christ. This is one of the many aspects of the secret gospels that Meyer examines with expert insight and creativity. Topics range from gender and infancy stories to discipleship and the relationship of the Gospel of Thomas to Islamic literature. Meyer&#39;s spellbinding readings of these materials offer fresh understandings of the canonical gospels. Marvin Meyer is Griset Professor of Bible and Christian Studies, and Director of the Albert Schweitzer Institute at Chapman University, Orange, California. He is author of The Secret Teachings of Jesus: Four Gnostic Gospels and The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus, and co-editor of Jesus Then and Now (Trinity Press International).</p><p>Marvin Meyer is Professor of Religious Studies at Chapman College."Meyer (Bible &amp; Christian studies, Chapman Univ.; director, Albert Schweitzer Inst.) is one of our most notable scholars on the extracoanonical mystery literature associated with the New Testament&#x2014;the Gospel of Thomas, the Secret Gospel of Mark, and the Gnostic Gospels. His new book deals principally with the enigmatic appearance of a naked or near-naked young man both in canonical and extracanonical writings dealing with Jesus. His book includes a respectful review of existing primary and secondary sources and culminates in a thoughtful comparison of the Mark fragments with the apparent myster-initiation depicted at the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii&#x2014;without, however, directly dealing with the potentially disturbing implications of that comparison regarding Jesus' own role in religious initiation practices. Still, his book is a capably written and thought-provoking discussion of a perennial puzzle in New Testament studies."&#x2014;Library Journal, March 2003 (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>If you wish to be hooked, read Marvin Meyer's erudite and compelling essays on the gospels of Thomas and Secret Mark, for his fresh study reads with the authority and suspense of Agatha Christie at her best. He commands first-century Greek, Coptic, and Syriac/Aramaic/Hebrew scriptures, their wisdom and messianic epiphanies and key recent scholarly interpretations. A distinguished biblical and gnostic scholar, Meyer immerses us in the light of an age, offering his syncretistic insights. Quietly countering those who would dismiss an early dating for Thomas, he makes this extraordinary gospel more relevant, citing Paul as one probably versed in Thomas's Jesus. With precision, innovation, and supple humor he calls a spade a spade.

Marvin Meyer has been one of the few New Testament scholars to make them a focus of his research and to incorporate them into a modern historical construct of Christian origins. For over twenty years Meyer has investigated the less-well known and less popular aspects of Christian origins, its lost gospels, and the unfamiliar ancient culture in which Christianity became a Hellenistic religion. His collected essays on the two most notorious of these ancient gospels, Thomas and Secret Mark, demonstrates their importance for the origins of Christianity and brings them into the main stream of New Testament scholarship."Charles W.

Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em>Stieg Larsson was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo. He was a leading expert on anti-democratic, right-wing extremist organisations. He died in 2004, soon after delivering the text of the novels that make up the Millennium Trilogy.</p><h2>Things that Fall from the Sky</h2><p>Weaving together loss and anxiety with fantastic elements and literary sleight-of-hand, Kevin Brockmeier&#x2019;s richly imagined <b>Things That Fall from the Sky</b> views the nagging realities of the world through a hopeful lens. <br><br>In the deftly told &#x201c;These Hands,&#x201d; a man named Lewis recounts his time babysitting a young girl and his inconsolable sense of loss after she is wrenched away. In &#x201c;Apples,&#x201d; a boy comes to terms with the complex world of adults, his first pangs of love, and the bizarre death of his Bible coach. &#x201c;The Jesus Stories&#x201d; examines a people trying to accelerate the Second Coming by telling the story of Christ in every possible way. And in the O. Henry Award winning &#x201c;The Ceiling,&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s marriage begins to disintegrate after the sky starts slowly descending.<br><br>Achingly beautiful and deceptively simple, <b>Things That Fall from the Sky</b> defies gravity as one of the most original story collections seen in recent years.</p><p>The stories in Kevin Brockmeier's debut collection require, test, try, exhaust, and--just often enough--reward the reader's patience. In <i>Things That Fall from the Sky</i>, Brockmeier writes in painstaking prose that's long on exposition and short on action. Many of these stories concern children. In "These Hands," a thirtysomething man, possibly with Nabokovian intentions, baby-sits an 18-month-old girl. In the title story, a depressive librarian finds relief, and even guidance, in the company of her small granddaughter. And in "The House at the End of the World," 4-year-old Holly describes her isolated life in a shack in the woods with her father: "This was during the collapse of civilization, and I believed we were the only people in the world." Here Brockmeier's expository style pays off, as he describes in detail father and daughter setting traps, lighting lanterns, and tracking streams. It's a kind of end-of-days <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i>, except, of course, the father is crazy, and civilization has not collapsed. In the end, Holly's mother comes to take her away, and Brockmeier doesn't shy for a moment from Holly's pain as she is carried "from the house and the bed and the world which were mine." At his best, Brockmeier writes with excruciatingly thorough imagination. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>&#x201c;Delightful, sad and often magical. . . . Brockmeier&#x2019;s small, carefully made worlds are like Steven Millhauser&#x2019;s; they are definitely fantastic and miraculously, utterly human.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;With so much madness abroad in the world, Brockmeier provides welcome magic. Without lapsing into the simplistic or the sentimental, the stories evoke a human desire to recall that childhood realm of fairy tale,&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel<br><br></i>&#x201c;Lyrical. . . . Brockmeier is clearly a talent. The stories are filled with the kinds of metaphors that make you see the world afresh.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Shout<br><br></i>&#x201c;The best pieces in this collection . . .allow that in some rare instances, storytelling has the power to redeem.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Village Voice<br><br></i>&#x201c;[A] generous collection. . . .

His paintings have now entered popular consciousness to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine how strongly they were resisted at the time. Much of the credit for his transformation is due to the author of these Recollections, dealer and art historian Wilhelm Uhde. It was Uhde who mounted the first exhibition of Rousseau&#x2019;s work, and the catalog he wrote for the occasion is the basis of the Recollections. In it, he painted a picture of a man of naivet�, humor, and total commitment to an art of whose importance he was utterly convinced.</p><p></p><h2>Fra Angelico</h2><p>Examines the life and work of possibly the most celebrated religious painter of the Italian Early Renaissance, Fra Giovanni da Fiesole, known as Fra Angelico.

She holds a PhD from the University of Virginia and BA from Sarah Lawrence College, New York, and has received many grants and awards for teaching and scholarship. She is the author of Benozzo Gozzoli and editor of The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio.&#34;Fra Angelico&#39;s work - unlike most old master art - was much admired by the post-war American master of spiritual abstraction Mark Rothko. Looking at the plates in this thorough and scholarly new study, with their combination of radiant-colour and pared-down simplicity, you can see why.&#34;-Sunday Telegraph &#34;[A] very well-written book... [Ahl] nimbly summarises the history of Florence in the opening years of the fifteenth century as a context for Fra Angelico&#39;s career, and the historiographic legacy of the artist, primarily in literature, from the fifteenth though the nineteenth centuries. These overviews condense the welter of miscellaneous information other writers have brought to bear on these topics and translate with finely balanced judgment into &#39;user-friendly&#39; form for the modern general-interest reader. The other great strength of this monograph is Ahl&#39;s care in elaborating the devotional content and significance of each painting by Fra Angelico that she discusses... The excurses offered here are models of concision, neither too detailed nor patronisingly summary.&#34;-Burlington Magazine &#34;A well-informed and scholarly text... A good read... Strong on the cultural, religious and historical context of Angelico&#39;s life and work ... a good overall survey.&#34;-The Art Book &#34;A new monograph of extraordinary breadth, careful scholarship and unparalleled beauty... Ahl&#39;s goal is to achieve a better understanding of the friar-artist by placing him in the context of those who influenced him, his contemporaries, and his deep Dominican spirituality... Unlike many previous scholars, [...] Ahl recognizes the obvious: this painter was a devout man of the church... [Ahl] engag[es] the reader with her clear, flowing prose... This superb monograph is the definitive study to date on Fra Angelico... In the exquisite photographic reproductions, colors appear rich, gold glistens, and delicate textures in gilded backgrounds are discernible. ... Bound in sumptuous lavender silk, the book is accessible to the interested reader, valuable to the scholar, and a must for any library.&#34;-Mary Baldwin College [Staunton, VA], Sixteenth Century Journal</p><h2>Visible Bones: Journeys Across Time in the Columbia River Country</h2><p>How can you know a place? Historian and naturalist Jack Nisbet&#x2014;author of Sources of the River: Tracking David Thompson Across Western North America&#x2014;looks to the relics of a region to connect the present moment to the distant past. In the vast Western territory defined by the Columbia River, Nisbet tracks the stories and meaning of relics such as a trilobite fossil that points to a tropical prehistoric ecology; the nearly extinct California condor, once the largest thing in the skies, described with amazement by Meriwether Lewis; the indelible stain of the smallpox pandemic that overcame the native peoples of the West; a rare and socially potent strain of indigenous wild tobacco that reveals the presence of vestigial Indian practices; and the remains of one Jaco Finlay, a mixed-blood trapper and scout who seems to have been everywhere in the region two hundred years ago. All of these relics are the visible bones that show how past is present in the Columbia River Country. Together the stories these bones tell lays out a wholly original, hybrid history that connects nature with human endeavor, geography with the passage of time&#x2014;all contribute to the biography of a place. The arrow of time travels in one direction, and this is usually how history is told: beginning to end. But Jack Nisbet is up to something else: journeys across time through a place, knitting past to present and back again to assemble a portrait of the land that marked the culmination of Lewis &amp; Clark&#x2019;s expedition, that saw the sad end of the Indian Wars with the flight of Chief Joseph, that has offered up fossil proof of mammoth species long extinct. In this western territory, the storied past is much in evidence.</p><p>Jack Nisbet is also the author of Sources of the River, Purple Flat Top, and The Mapmakers Eye. He lives in Spokane, WA.Whether wading through the waters of the Columbia River or walking through the woods, biologist and history teacher Nisbet finds the remains of the Pacific Northwest's past and goes to great lengths to explain how these remnants got there. Nisbet (Sources of the River; Purple Flat Top; etc.), whose blood races when he touches ancient things, finds a trilobite fossil and is flushed with warmth, despite being knee-deep in icy water. He begins with historical accounts of trilobites and salamanders, and quickly moves up the evolutionary ladder to mammoths and even humans. He catalogues numerous historical encounters with California condors, including an amusing one in which naturalist John Kirk Townsend winged a condor along the Willamette River in 1835. Shedding his clothes and gun, Townsend crossed the river and, completely naked. battled the condor, which had a 10-foot wingspan, until he managed to knock the bird unconscious by hitting it with a well-thrown stone. The author also reports humankind's less victorious encounters with nature, including the terrible toll that smallpox and other diseases took on the Native American tribes of the Northwest.

The study adds thinly to what we already know about President Reagan's (and then-vice-president Bush's) knowledge of and involvement in the arms-for-hostages deal and the diversion of funds, but Draper's scholarly efforts deepen our understanding of other major elements of the affair: for example, the exclusion of secretaries of State and Defense Schultz and Weinberger after January 1986, the role of CIA director William Casey, and the administration's attempt to shift blame for its Iran policy to the Israelis. This is the fullest and most authoritative account to date of the usurpation of power by a small, strategically placed group of insiders--lieutenant colonel North, admiral Poindexter et al.--and is also an instructive exploration of the line that separates the legitimate from the illegitimate exercise of power. Photos. BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Veteran writer Draper has reconstructed from the voluminous documentary records the Washington connection that linked the arms sales to Khomeini's Iran with the support of the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua. With keen analytical insight, he seeks out "a very thin line" that "separates" the legitimate from the illegitimate exercise of power in our government" and portrays these tangled events as "symptomatic of a far deeper disorder in the American body politic," a disorder based on the assumption of "a president almighty in foreign policy." While Stephen Kinzer's Blood of Brothers ( LJ 3/15/91) and Joseph P. Persico's The Lives and Secrets of William J. Casey: from the OSS to the CIA ( LJ 10/1/90) cover specific aspects of these events, Draper's work will stand as the definitive source on the constitutional consequences of the Iran-Contra affairs for decades to come.

But according to Noeleen McIlvenna, the true exemplars of egalitarian political values had fled Virginia's plantation society late in the seventeenth century to create the first successful European colony in the Albemarle, in present-day North Carolina. <br><br>Making their way through the Great Dismal Swamp, runaway servants from Virginia joined other renegades to establish a free society along the most inaccessible Atlantic coastline of North America. They created a new community on the banks of Albemarle Sound, maintaining peace with neighboring Native Americans, upholding the egalitarian values of the English Revolution, and ignoring the laws of the mother country.<br><br>Tapping into previously unused documents, McIlvenna explains how North Carolina's first planters struggled to impose a plantation society upon the settlers and how those early small farmers, defending a wide franchise and religious toleration, steadfastly resisted. She contends that the story of the Albemarle colony is a microcosm of the greater process by which a conglomeration of loosely settled, politically autonomous communities eventually succumbed to hierarchical social structures and elite rule. Highlighting the relationship between settlers and Native Americans, this study leads to a surprising new interpretation of the Tuscarora War.<br><br></p><p>"McIlvenna demonstrates that North Carolina settlers marched to the beat of their own drums, making the state's early history profoundly different from that of any other early North American colony. <i>A Very Mutinous People</i> puts forth an important argument, fleshes out an ill-understood part of North Carolina's early history, and unearths a forgotten episode of early modern resistance to political and economic dependence."--Marjoleine Kars, author of <i>Breaking Loose Together: The Regulator Rebellion in Pre-Revolutionary North Carolina</i> <br>Noeleen McIlvenna is professor of history at Wright State University in Ohio.</p><h2>History Of The United States Mint and Its Coinage (HISTORY OF THE U.

Drawing on a number of current literary theories (but avoiding most of their jargon), Attebery makes a case for fantasy as a significant movement within postmodern literature rather than as a simple exercise of nostalgia. Attebury examines recent and classic fantasies by Ursula K. Le Guin, John Crowley, J.R.R. Tolkien, Diana Wynne Jones, and Gene Wolfe, among others. In both its popular and postmodern incarnations, fantasic fiction exhibits a remarkable capacity for reinventing narrative concentions. Attebery shows how plots, characters, settings, storytelling frameworks, gender divisions, and references to cultural texts such as history and science are all called into question the moment the marvelous is admited into a story.</p></p><p><p>Brian Attebery is Associate Professor of English and Director of American Studies at Idaho State University.

They review the current state of land claims. They tackle the persistence of racism among non-Indigenous people and institutions. They celebrate Indigenous Rights Movements while decrying the role of government-funded organizations like the Assembly of First Nations. They document the federal government's disregard for the substance of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples while claiming to implement it.

Few of us understand the how and why of jetting from New York to London in six hours. How does a plane stay in the air? Can turbulence bring it down? What is windshear? How good are the security checks? Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of Salon.com's popular column, "Ask the Pilot," unravels the secrets and tells you all there is to know about the strange and fascinating world of commercial flight. He offers:</p> <ul><li>A nuts and bolts explanation of how planes fly</li> <li>Insights into safety and security</li> <li>Straight talk about turbulence, air traffic control, windshear, and crashes</li> <li>The history, color, and controversy of the world's airlines</li> <li>The awe and oddity of being a pilot</li> <li>The poetry and drama of airplanes, airports, and traveling abroad</li></ul> <p>In a series of frank, often funny explanations and essays, Smith speaks eloquently to our fears and curiosities, incorporating anecdotes, memoir, and a life's passion for flight. He tackles our toughest concerns, debunks conspiracy theories and myths, and in a rarely heard voice dares to return a dash of romance and glamour to air travel.</p></p><p>My love of commercial aviation nurtured a passion for seeing the world, and I encourage that passion in others. I'd never have traipsed off to sixty-some countries if I hadn't been infatuated with the airplane first, and what underpins my writing is a desire that readers, too, will come to see the airplane as more than just an inconvenient means to an end. <p>I wanted to write a book that didn't sound like it was written by a pilot. Ask the Pilot is meant to be unexpectedly thoughtful, provocative, and even a bit eccentric. It is more than a collection of facts, stats, and gee-whiz about planes; it touches on everything from aerodynamics and safety issues to airport architecture and the liveries of the world's airlines.</p><p><b>Patrick Smith</b> is an airline pilot and freelance writer.

He worked as a primary school teacher and held various academic posts at universities in Britain, Ireland and America. The Observer once hailed him as &#39;Ireland&#39;s greatest living novelist&#39;. He was the author of six highly acclaimed novels and four collections of short stories, and was the recipient of numerous awards and honours, including a Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship, the American-Irish Award, the Prix Etrangere Ecureuil, the Chevalier de l&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and, most recently, a South Bank Award for Literature. Amongst Women, which won both the GPA and the Irish Times Award, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1990 and made into a four-part BBC television series. His work has appeared in anthologies and has been translated into many languages. John McGahern died in March 2006, aged 71.A lyric lament for Ireland, McGahern's lovingly observed family drama is dominated by an almost pathetic paterfamilias. Gruff, blustering Michael Moran, former guerrilla hero in the Irish War of Independence, is a man "in permanent opposition." Now a farmer, he vents his compulsion to dominate, his cold fury and sense of betrayal on his three teenage daughters. Yearning for approval but fearing his flare-ups, they periodically beat a path back to the farmhouse from London and Dublin, then take flight again, both proud and dependent. Moran's second wife, Rose, much younger than he, displays saintly patience in her attempts to heal this splintering family. Moran also claims a renegade son in London who is "turning himself into a sort of Englishman," and another son driven away by Moran's threats of beatings. McGahern ( The Dark ; The Pornographer ) has crafted a wise and tender novel whose brooding hero seems emblematic of an Ireland that drives away its sons and daughters. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Exit Ghost (Vintage International)</h2><p>Nathan Zuckerman returns to New York in the long-awaited final installment of Philip Roth's renowned Zuckerman series.<br><br>Alone for eleven years on his New England mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no media, no terrorist threats, no women, no tasks other than his work and the enduring of old age.

Along with his surprising and unsettling encounters with an aged and ill woman who had once been a young mystery to him, an aggressive biographer who won't take no for an answer, and an alluring young writer who tempts him back into the adventure of seduction, he is confronted with a city whose streets are filled with people behaving quite differently than a decade before. "For one who frequently went without talking to anyone for days at a time," he thinks. "I had to wonder what that had previously held them up had collapsed in people to make incessant talking into a telephone preferable to walking about under no one's surveillance, momentarily solitary, assimilating the street through one's animal senses and thinking the myriad thoughts that the activities of a city inspire."

Broad in scope and sensitive in its analytic insight, Harris' work is an accessible piece of work for anyone curious to learn more about why people choose to eat differently and how food has cultural connections on a myriad of levels." -- Eve Bratman, <i>American University</i>Author of Cannibals and Kings and other notable studies, anthropologist Harris here presents his findings on the "puzzling eating habits" of humans. Drawing from his research on a wide range of ancient and modern societies, he offers his theories of the effects that religious laws and customs have had on cultural attitudes toward foods. There are chapters on the approved and the forbidden: beef, horsemeat and the flesh of other animals, including humans, fish, insects. Harris documents his provocative views on regulations governing comestibles in various cultures. For instance, he concludes that swineherding was impractical for nomadic desert dwellers, hence pork became taboo not because pigs were unclean but because they needed too much care. As for taste preferences, Harris notes that "good to eat" translates as "good to sell" in profit-conscious countries like the U.S. Macmillan Book Club selection; Library of Science and Natural Science alternate; foreign rights: Marcella Berger, S &amp; S.

He is a former president of the South African Society of Journalists and has received awards in South Africa for defense of press freedom and in the United States for excellence in religious journalism."The Bible is dynamite . . . nothing could be more radical." For South Africa's famous Anglican Archbishop Tutu, the choice between prayer and social action is not an either-or proposition; "rather, prayer inevitably drove you off your knees into action." Much has been written about Tutu's role as head of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where apartheid perpetrators came forward to confess and ask forgiveness, but the focus of this compelling biography by his longtime media secretary is on Tutu's dynamic leadership role in the apartheid resistance when those racist perpetrators were in power. The inside story of his life is also a gripping history of the fight for peaceful change. Tutu's passionate comments, whether he is meeting with world leaders to campaign for economic sanctions or defusing violent street battles at home, are both fierce and funny. But they can also be moving, as when he accepted the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize not for himself but for the millions of his people who had been uprooted and dumped as if they were rubbish. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The victims of a wartime pact struck with the emperor Marcus Aurelius to ensure the future of Sarmatia, Ariantes and his troop of accomplished horsemen are sent to Hadrian's Wall. Unsurprisingly, the Sarmatians hate Britain--an Island of Ghosts, filled with pale faces, stone walls, and an uneasy past.<br><br>Struggling to command his own people to defend a land they despise, Ariantes is accepted by all, but trusted by none. The Romans fear his barbarian background, and his own men fear his gradual Roman assimilation. When Ariantes uncovers a conspiracy sure to damage both his Roman benefactors and his beloved countrymen, as well as put him and the woman he loves in grave danger, he must make a difficult decision--one that will change his own life forever.<br></p><p>Gillian Bradshaw's father, an American Associated Press newsman, met her mother, a confidential secretary for the British embassy, in Rio de Janeiro.

We left Aquincum late in July, and rode through the heat of August: the dust and the flies were appalling. Most of the army bases where we stopped along the way didn't have proper supplies laid up for such a large body of men, as nobody had sent messages telling them to do so; of what they did have, the Roman troops took the best for themselves, leaving us sour barley soup and coarse black bread. We weren't used to the diet, and it made us ill. The hooves of our horses wore down on the paved Roman roads, and the beasts went lame. The Romans refused to give us leather to make horse-sandals, so we cut up the leather bindings of our wagons awnings. Then, early in September when we left the Rhine and turned west into Gaul, it began to rain, and the water ran through the loose awnings and soaked everything: bedding, food, clothes. Everything stank of wet wool, wet horses, rotting barley, and unwashed wet men, and we hated the hell of our own skis. Only our armor and weapons were safe: they had been wrapped in oilcloths at Aquincum and packed into twenty wagons of their own, which the Romans took charge of.<br>Then one afternoon, just before the middle of September, we were starting down from the hills when we saw it: the ocean. It had rained all that morning, but the rain had stopped about midday, and now the sky was clearing. The clouds parted and let down a watery light westward beyond us, and we looked up and saw a huge gray plain turn suddenly and impossibly blue. We had never seen the sea. We reined in our horses and stopped in the road, starting at it. The sun shimmered on the waves as far out as our eyes could see: no shadow of land darkened even the farthest limit of the horizon.<br>"It's the end of the world!" whispered Arshak.<br>Gatalas gave a long wail of grief and dismay and covered his face. The sound rose up above the clatter and rumble of the troops behind us and before us, and when it stopped, there was complete silence. Then there was a rustling whisper--"What is it?" "The sea, we've reached the sea"--running back down the line. A few dozen men and horses trotted forward, leaving the road and fanning out across the hill. Then was silence again.<br>Marcus Flavius Facilis, the senior centurion in charge of us, came galloping us from some discussion with his subordinates. He was a stocky, bull-necked man, white-haired, with a face that went crimson when he was angry. It was beginning to go crimson now. "What's the matter with you bastards now?" he demanded, in Latin. He always ways spoke to us in his own language, though few of the officers and even fewer of the men understood it. During the long journey he had not bothered to learn Sarmatian even enough to give us orders.<br>Arshak, who did understand it, pointed at the sea. Gatalas didn't even look at him, but say with his hands over his face, rocking back and forth in his saddle.<br>Facilis only glanced at the sea. His eyes slid lightly away from that shining vision of blue and silver, and fixed instead on the city down the hill from us, a comfortable huddle of red life tile and gray thatch. He sat back in his saddle with a grunt of satisfaction. "Bononia!" he exclaimed, almost cheerfully. "Bononia at last! That's where we'll be staying tonight. And tomorrow I can say good-bye to the whole stinking lot of you. Come on, you bastards: hurry up and you'll sleep in dry beds tonight."<br>"And tomorrow?" asked Arshak, very quietly. "Where will we sleep tomorrow?"<br>"That depends how long it takes to embark you all," replied Facilis. "I imagine it will take a few days to ferry all of you across."<br>"They said there was an island," said Arshak, still very quietly. "They said that we would be sent to an island called Britain, and there we would have our weapons back, and be accepted as soldiers of the Romans, and receive honorable appointments and payment for our service. That is what the emperor himself swore to us at Aquincum."<br>"Yes," agreed Facilis, "and the sooner you get down this hill--"<br>"There is no island," said Arshak.<br>"May I persih!" said Facilis, going red again. "What the hell do you mean?"<br>Gatalas took his hands away from his face. "There is nothing there!" he screamed. "Nothing! Nothing but ocean!" He turned his head away from that terrible immensity.<br>"You pigheaded barbarians!" shouted Facilis. "You stinking idiots! Of course there's an island. It's across there"--he waved his hand at the sea--"about thirty miles off."<br>Arshak shook his head. "No," he said, "no. You lie to us, Roman. You lied to us all along. You, the emperor, all of you. You lie. There is no island."<br>Facilis' face was growing steadily reader. "You stupid bastard! By every god on earth or under it! Why would I march a troop of lunatic Sarmatians all the way from Aquincum to Bononia if there wasn't anywhere to send them when we got there? I wouldn't do it for the love of barbarian company, I can promise you that!"<br>"You would do it to cause our deaths," replied Arshak, still very quietly. He never raised his voice when he was angry, never swore, and never boasted. He was a member of the royal clan, second son of the king's own brother, and he had been taught that a nobleman answers insults only with his spear. It was lucky that the spear was stowed away in the weapons wagons, with Facilis' men guarding it. Otherwise Facilis would have been dead several times over, and Arshak as well, executed for murdering a Roman officer.<br>Facilis glared at him. He wiped his hands down the sides of his tunic. "The emperor wants you alive," he declared. "He wants you in his army. He swore to give you honorable posts, and you swore to serve him faithfully. Do you mean to break your oaths now, just because you've seen the sea?"<br>"The emperor wanted to kill our whole nation," Arshak returned. "He lied to us."<br>"If we go there," said Gatalas, jabbing a hand fearfully toward the sea, "we will die in the water."<br>"No!" Facilis insisted. He did not bother to deny that the emperor had wanted to exterminate our whole nation--everyone knew that was true--but he turned instead to his first point. "There is an island there."<br>We all stared at him.<br>"There's a huge island there, you stupid bastards! There's whole Roman province, with cities and roads and three legions and the gods know how many troops of auxiliaries! The ocean's bigger than the gods-hated Danube, you idiots: you can't expect to see clear across it!"<br>Arshak glanced up the hill behind us. Behind a handful of our officers, Facilis' legionaries waited, leaning on their javelins and watching us. Two full cohorts of them, sixteen hundred men, drawn up six abreast: their ranks stretched up the road out of sight. The rest of our men were behind them, and the wagon with the weapons were still farther away, with the baggage. Of the two troops of Roman auxiliary cavalry, one was strung out down the road before us, waiting, and the other was guarding the baggage.<br>Arshak looked back at Facilis and smiled. Then, saying nothing, he touched his horse and started down the hill again, and the rest of us followed him in silence. Facilis sat still on his own horse, swearing as we rode past.<br>"We will not go on their ships," said Gatalas, in Sarmatian, when we were well ahead of him.<br>"Of course not," replied Arshak. "It's a trick. We'd be helpless on a ship, with our horses packed in a hold like sheep, and our weapons left onshore. They wouldn't even need to use swords on us. A few good swimmers could take us out, sink us and the vessel, and escape themselves without the least danger."<br>"Death in battle is better than drowning," Gatalas declared, rubbing the hilt of his dagger. "But I'd prefer it if I had something more than this and a rope to fight with. Do you think we could get our weapons back?"<br>"Probably," said Arshak, almost eagerly. "My men have managed to keep thirty bows, forty quivers of arrows, and sixty swords hidden in our wagons. How many do your troops have?"<br>"Fifty bows and twenty-seven swords," Gatalas replied promptly. "But only thirty quivers of arrows."<br>"Ariantes?"<br>"Fifty-nine bows, sixty quivers of arrows, and a dozen swords," I said, reluctantly. "But they're all well hidden, and it will take a little time to get them out. Facilis is suspicious. He'll find some way to obstruct us. Either we won't be allowed near our wagons, or we won't be allowed near our men, or both."<br>"Facilis won't be in charge in Bononia," Arshak answered confidently. "The camp will have its own commander. Bononia's a big place; the commander will be an important man, a legate or a procurator. You must have noticed how ever tribunes don't like taking orders from centurions, however senior. It won't take much to ensure that we're sent off to the wagons with our men." Arshak smiled again, then added vehemently, "Facilis is mine."<br>I sighed. I was not sure what I felt when I looked at the sea, but it was not anger or fear. Perhaps it was hope. I'd had enough of the worlds I knew, Sarmatian and Roman both, and here we'd ridden to the world's end and were climbing down to touch something huge and mysterious beyond it. Why should I stop, here in this Roman city? Why not go on? I remembered the time long before when I had journeyed east, hoping to reach the Jade Gate of the Silk Country. I had been called back, halfway there. I regretted that still. Why stop again now, just short of the ocean?<br>Of course, I was tired. Some things had happened in the Roman war that had left me stunned, and when the war ended, I felt like one of the dead. I had a leg wound, too, which had meant that I'd ridden the first seven hundred miles of the journey with my leg in a splint, dazed with pain, and I'd floated through them in a kind of dream. Sometimes I woke up with a start and stared at myself in astonishment, but mostly I rode, ate, made camp, and gave orders to my men, all as though I were trailing behind myself and watching.<br>"What if they're telling the truth?" I asked. "What if there is an island?"<br>"Why should you believe them?" returned Arshak, swiftly and angrily. "Why should we trust them?"<br>"I don't trust them," I answered wearily. "But we swore oaths to the emperor, and we aren't yet certain that he was lying. If we fight them now, we will all die. You want to kill Facilis--but if you have to pay for the pleasure with the blood of all your men, is it worth it? Even if we managed to win our weapons, even if we gave them such a battering that they locked themselves in their forts and us out, still we couldn't get home, not through a thousand miles of land held by our enemies. And the emperor would look at what we'd done, and note that even when Sarmatian troops surrender in a peace settlement, they can still rebel and shed Roman blood. He'd have no use for Sarmatian troops ever again. What could our people give then, to buy peace?"<br>Arshak scowled. "He wanted to kill us all anyway. He has betrayed us and he will betray those at home, whatever we do."<br>"Better to die on land than in the water," agreed Gatalas. "At leas on land the soul can fly free to the sun."<br>"But what if there is an island? If there is an island, it would be we who first betrayed them."<br>"An island in the ocean, beyond the limit of the world!" scoffed Arshak. "And what's more, an invisible one! If Facilis told you that there was an island in the sky and that you must climb up a mountain and jump off to reach it--would you believe him, and jump?"<br>"I wouldn't choose a path that would end with all my men dead without at least tossing a stone off the mountain and looking where it landed! And I am not sure that the Romans would invent a Roman province across the ocean, simply to trick us. Britain may well lie thirty miles from here."<br>"I will not cross the ocean!" cried Gatalas. "I will die cleanly in this world, and so will my men!" He stretched his hand toward the sun. "On fire I swear it!"<br>We rode on for a moment with the oath ringing in our ears. There didn't seem to be any point in continuing the argument.<br>But I couldn't leave it. When we reached this camp, we would have to begin planning our mutiny--and the more I considered it, the les likely it seemed that the Romans had invented Britain to deceive us. I had five hundred men who depended upon me to do what was best for them. "If I went," I said at last, reluctantly, "on my own, without you, without any of my own people--if I went to see if this island was there, and came back and reported to you that it was--what would you do then?"<br>Gatalas looked at me fearfully. "What if it's not an earthly island?" he asked, in a low voice. "If it's there, beyond the ocean, it might be...a place where the dead walk. What would you be like if you came back then?"<br>"You'd still know, then, from looking at me, that you should not cross. You'd be free to fight the Romans with a clear conscience."<br>"I'm not sure we'd notice any difference if you came back as a ghost, Ariantes," Arshak said, trying to lighten the air a little. I met his eyes, and he dropped his smile: the joke was too true to be funny.<br>"Someone should check what the truth is before we take up arms," I said.<br>"And if they refuse to let you go and come back again?" Arshak demanded.<br>"Then, again, we'll know that they're lying and we need have no doubts about fighting them."<br>"Very well, very well," Arshak said quietly. "Very well. You're right: we must toss our stone off the mountain and see where it falls. A pity: my hands ache for a spear every time I see Facilis, and I will regret it as long as I live if he goes home to Aquincum unharmed." After a moment he added, "And you're willing to go? Because I'm not. It would mean swallowing what I said to Facilis."<br>"I am willing to go," I said. "I'll tell Facilis as much this evening. Can I tell him that if we know he's acting in good faith, we will go on their ships?"<br>Gatalas flinched, but, after a moment, nodded. "I will not be the first to break an oath."<br>"Nor will I," said Arshak again, unhappily. "But we'll see what we can arrange for the Romans if it happens that they're lying."<br>Arshak was quite right about at least one thing, however: the procurator of the naval base where we stopped that night did not want to take his orders from Flavius Facilis. He'd had letters about us, and when we arrived he came out to the gate to look at us. It was easy for us to guess who the figure standing on the battlement was: he was wearing the long crimson cloak and gilded armor, and when we got closer we could see he had the narrow purple stripe on his tunic, marking him as a member of the Roman equestrian order. Arshak galloped up to the gate, stopped his horse, saluted respectfully, greeted him as "Lord," and asked him where we could put our wagons. By the time Facilis had cantered up and suggested that we be confined to barracks instead, the procurator had already granted us leave to arrange the wagons in the shipyard, and wouldn't back down: an equestrian appointed by the emperor doesn't change his arrangements because a centurion who struggled up through the ranks thinks he ought to. Facilis turned crimson and swore under his breath, but had to accept it. He followed ...</p><h2>Knitting on the Edge: Ribs*Ruffles*Lace*Fringes*Flora*Points &amp; Picots - The Essential Collection of 350 Decorative Borders</h2><p>The now-classic collection of 350 edgings, borders, and trims by acclaimed designer Nicky Epstein is available in paperback!

Gundersheimer's full-color pictures replace the red-and-blue dominated originals. However, at times the smaller size of the new version seems to crowd the text. The theme of a toddler's physical growth and mastery of simple tasks continues in the second book. Here mother's work basket has been replaced with a desk and Gundersheimer's illustrative style works well in the small format. The full-color pictures are more striking than the pink-and-green originals and the 1992 Very Little Girl is more robust and active than her 1953 counterpart. However, the earlier titles employed more imaginative typography to underscore contrasts in size. Both stories end with the child assuming the new role of older sibling. Although there is no reason to abandon Krasilovsky's originals, librarians might want to brighten their shelves these new versions. --Kathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fragrant Orchids: A Guide to Selecting, Growing, and Enjoying</h2><p>Orchid lovers of all levels will delight in this unique approach to selecting new and exciting varieties of fragrant orchids.

"Though traditionally considered a Catholic act of devotion," he contends, "the Rosary, with its primary focus on the life, death, and resurrection of Christ Jesus, is ultimately a catholic, or universal, prayer&#x2014;one that can appeal to Christians of all faiths and denominations." The Rosary, attempts to cut through the myths of this sacred prayer and get to the heart of the matter&#x2014;which is an ecumenical, meditative journey that illuminates the teachings of the New Testament. <p>Written for Catholics and Protestants and divided into two sections, The Rosary offers useful instructions on how to get the most out of this spiritual exercise of repeating prayers. It includes a visual and scriptural journey through the mysteries of the Rosary&#x2014;including excerpts from the New Testament and reproduction of famous paintings by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Raphael, and many others.</p></p><p>GARY JANSEN is an editor at Doubleday Religion and former editor-in-chief of the Quality Paperback Book Club.

Lomax developed a passion for American folk songs that ultimately made him one of the foremost authorities on this fundamental aspect of Americana. Across many decades and throughout the country, Lomax and his informants created over five thousand recordings of America's musical heritage, including ballads, blues, children's songs, fiddle tunes, field hollers, lullabies, play-party songs, religious dramas, spirituals, and work songs. He acted as honorary curator of the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, directed the Slave Narrative Project of the WPA, and cofounded the Texas Folklore Society. Lomax's books include <i>Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads</i>, <i>American Ballads and Folk Songs</i>, <i>Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Leadbelly</i>, and <i>Our Singing Country</i>, the last three coauthored with his son Alan Lomax.</p><p><i>Adventures of a Ballad Hunter</i> is a memoir of Lomax's eventful life. It recalls his early years and the fruitful decades he spent on the road collecting folk songs, on his own and later with son Alan and second wife Ruby Terrill Lomax. Vibrant, amusing, often haunting stories of the people he met and recorded are the gems of this book, which also gives lyrics for dozens of songs. <i>Adventures of a Ballad Hunter</i> illuminates vital traditions in American popular culture and the labor that has gone into their preservation.</p></p><p>John A. Lomax (1867&#x2013;1948) recorded classics such as &#x201c;Home on the Range&#x201d; and &#x201c;Goodnight Irene&#x201d; and with son Alan helped launch the musical careers of Leadbelly and Pete Seeger. His extensive recordings and papers are housed in the Library of Congress and the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin."It's such an important book, too, as well as being a hugely enjoyable one; it's an essential part of America's history, as well as its musical one." (Shirley Collins, MBE, <i>Lodestar</i> (2016) is her seventh studio album)<br><br>"At long last, John Lomax&#x2019;s account of his efforts to elevate folk songs to the realm of high literature is back in print. It&#x2019;s a story of one man&#x2019;s struggle to get singers to sing for him, scholars to pay attention, and for all Americans to hear their own history unfold before them in song. A true American odyssey."

While the networks continued to chase the lowest common denominator, a wave of new shows, first on premium cable channels like HBO and then basic cable networks like FX and AMC, dramatically stretched television&#x2019;s narrative inventiveness, emotional resonance, and artistic ambition. No longer necessarily concerned with creating always-likable characters, plots that wrapped up neatly every episode, or subjects that were deemed safe and appropriate, shows such as The Wire, The Sopranos, Mad Men, Deadwood, The Shield, and more tackled issues of life and death, love and sexuality, addiction, race, violence, and existential boredom. Just as the Big Novel had in the 1960s and the subversive films of New Hollywood had in 1970s, television shows became the place to go to see stories of the triumph and betrayals of the American Dream at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br><br>This revolution happened at the hands of a new breed of auteur: the all-powerful writer-show runner. These were men nearly as complicated, idiosyncratic, and &#x201c;difficult&#x201d; as the conflicted protagonists that defined the genre. Given the chance to make art in a maligned medium, they fell upon the opportunity with unchecked ambition.<br><br>Combining deep reportage with cultural analysis and historical context, Brett Martin recounts the rise and inner workings of a genre that represents not only a new golden age for TV but also a cultural watershed. Difficult Men features extensive interviews with all the major players, including David Chase (The Sopranos), David Simon and Ed Burns (The Wire), Matthew Weiner and Jon Hamm (Mad Men), David Milch (NYPD Blue, Deadwood), and Alan Ball (Six Feet Under), in addition to dozens of other writers, directors, studio executives, actors, production assistants, makeup artists, script supervisors, and so on. Martin takes us behind the scenes of our favorite shows, delivering never-before-heard story after story and revealing how cable TV has distinguished itself dramatically from the networks, emerging from the shadow of film to become a truly significant and influential part of our culture.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Brett Martin is a Correspondent for <i>GQ</i> and a 2012 James Beard Journalism Award winner.

Ever since <i>The Sopranos</i> had debuted in 1999, turning Tony&#x2014;anxiety-prone dad, New Jersey mobster, suburban seeker of meaning&#x2014;into a millennial pop culture icon, the character&#x2019;s frustration, volatility, and anger had often been indistinguishable from those qualities of James Gandolfini, the actor who brought them to life. The role was a punishing one, requiring not only vast amounts of nightly memorization and long days under hot lights, but also a daily descent into Tony&#x2019;s psyche&#x2014;at the best of times a worrisome place to dwell; at the worst, ugly, violent, and sociopathic.</p><p>Some actors&#x2014;notably Edie Falco, who played Tony&#x2019;s wife, Carmela Soprano&#x2014;are capable of plumbing such depths without getting in over their heads. Blessed with a near photographic memory, Falco could show up for work, memorize her lines, play the most emotionally devastating of scenes, and then return happily to her trailer to join her regular companion, Marley, a gentle yellow Lab mix.</p><p>Not so Gandolfini, for whom playing Tony Soprano would always require to some extent <i>being </i>Tony Soprano. Crew members grew accustomed to hearing grunts and curses coming from his trailer as he worked up to the emotional pitch of a scene by, say, destroying a boom box radio. An intelligent and intuitive actor, Gandolfini understood this dynamic and sometimes used it to his advantage; the heavy bathrobe that became Tony&#x2019;s signature, transforming him into a kind of domesticated bear, was murder under the lights in midsummer, but Gandolfini insisted on wearing it between takes. Other times, though, simulated misery became indistinguishable from the real thing&#x2014;on set and off. In papers related to a divorce filing at the end of 2002, Gandolfini&#x2019;s wife described increasingly serious issues with drugs and alcohol, as well as arguments during which the actor would repeatedly punch himself in the face out of frustration. To anybody who had witnessed the actor&#x2019;s self-directed rage as he struggled to remember lines in front of the camera&#x2014;he would berate himself in disgust, curse, smack the back of his own head&#x2014;it was a plausible scenario.</p><p>It did not help that the naturally shy Gandolfini was suddenly one of the most recognizable men in America&#x2014;especially in New York and New Jersey, where the show filmed and where the sight of him walking down the street with, say, a cigar was guaranteed to seed confusion in those already inclined to shout the names of fictional characters at real human beings. Unlike Falco, who could slip off Carmela&#x2019;s French-tipped nails, throw on a baseball cap, and disappear in a crowd, Gandolfini&#x2014;six feet tall, upward of 250 pounds&#x2014;had no place to hide.</p><p>All of which had long since taken its toll by the winter of 2002. Gandolfini&#x2019;s sudden refusals to work had become a semiregular occurrence. His fits were passive-aggressive: he would claim to be sick, refuse to leave his TriBeCa apartment, or simply not show up. The next day, inevitably, he would feel so wretched about his behavior and the massive logistic disruptions it had caused&#x2014;akin to turning an aircraft carrier on a dime&#x2014;that he would treat cast and crew to extravagant gifts. &#x201c;All of a sudden there&#x2019;d be a sushi chef at lunch,&#x201d; one crew member remembered. &#x201c;Or we&#x2019;d all get massages.&#x201d; It had come to be understood by all involved as part of the price of doing business, the trade-off for getting the remarkably intense, fully inhabited Tony Soprano that Gandolfini offered.</p><p>So when the actor failed to show up for a six p.m. call at Westchester County Airport to shoot the final appearance of the character Furio Giunta, a night shoot involving a helicopter, few panicked. &#x201c;It was an annoyance, but it wasn&#x2019;t cause for concern,&#x201d; said Terence Winter, the writer-producer on set that night. &#x201c;You know, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s just money.&#x2019; I mean, it was <i>a ton </i>of money&#x2014;we shut down a fucking airport. Nobody was particularly sad to go home at nine thirty on a Friday night.&#x201d;</p><p>Over the next twelve hours, it would become clear that this time was different. This time, Gandolfini was just <i>gone</i>.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>The operation that came to a halt that evening was a massive one. <i>The Sopranos </i>had spread out to occupy most of two floors of Silvercup Studios, a steel-and-brick onetime bread factory at the foot of the Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City, Queens. Downstairs, the production filmed on four of Silvercup&#x2019;s huge stages, including the ominously named Stage X, on which sat an endlessly reconfigurable, almost life-size model of the Soprano family&#x2019;s New Jersey McMansion. The famous view of the family&#x2019;s backyard&#x2014;brick patio and swimming pool, practically synonymous with suburban ennui&#x2014;lay rolled up on an enormous translucent polyurethane curtain that could be wheeled behind the ersatz kitchen windows and backlit when needed.</p><p>A small army, in excess of two hundred people, was employed in fabricating such details, which added up to as rich and fleshed out a universe as had ever existed on TV: carpenters, electricians, painters, seamstresses, drivers, accountants, cameramen, location scouts, caterers, writers, makeup artists, audio engineers, prop masters, set dressers, scenic designers, production assistants of every stripe. Out in Los Angeles, a whole other team of postproduction crew&#x2014;editors, mixers, color correctionists, music supervisors&#x2014;was stationed. Dailies were shuttled back and forth between the coasts under a fake company name&#x2014;Big Box Productions&#x2014;to foil spies anxious to spoil feverishly anticipated plot points. What had started three years earlier as an oddball, what-do-we-have-to-lose experiment for a network still best known for rerunning Hollywood movies had become a huge bureaucratic institution.</p><p>More than that, to be at Silvercup at that moment was to stand at the center of a television revolution. Although the change had its roots in a wave of quality network TV begun two decades before, it had started in earnest five years earlier, when the pay subscription network HBO began turning its attention to producing original, hour-long dramas. By the start of 2002, with Gandolfini at large, the medium had been transformed.</p><p>Soon the dial would begin to fill with Tony Sopranos. Within three months, a bald, stocky, flawed, but charismatic boss&#x2014;this time of a band of rogue cops instead of mafiosi&#x2014;would make his first appearance, on FX&#x2019;s <i>The Shield</i>. Mere months after that, on <i>The Wire</i>, viewers would be introduced to a collection of Baltimore citizens that included an alcoholic, narcissistic police officer, a ruthless drug lord, and a gay, homicidal stickup boy. HBO had already followed the success of <i>The Sopranos </i>with <i>Six Feet Under</i>, a series about a family-run funeral home filled with characters that were perhaps less sociopathic than these other cable denizens but could be equally unlikable. In the wings lurked such creatures as <i>Deadwood</i>&#x2019;s<i> </i>Al Swearengen, as cretinous a character as would ever appear on television, much less in the role of protagonist, and <i>Rescue Me</i>&#x2019;s Tommy Gavin, an alcoholic, self-destructive firefighter grappling poorly with the ghosts of 9/11. Andrew Schneider, who wrote for <i>The Sopranos</i> in its final season, had cut his teeth writing for TV&#x2019;s version of <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>,<i> </i>in which each episode, by rule, featured at least two instances of mild-mannered, regretful David Banner &#x201c;hulking out&#x201d; and morphing into a giant, senseless green id. This would turn out to be good preparation for writing a serialized cable drama twenty years later.</p><p>These were characters whom, conventional wisdom had once insisted, Americans would never allow into their living rooms: unhappy, morally compromised, complicated, deeply human. They played a seductive game with the viewer, daring them to emotionally invest in, even root for, even love, a gamut of criminals whose offenses would come to include everything from adultery and polygamy (<i>Mad Men</i> and <i>Big Love</i>)<i> </i>to vampirism and serial murder (<i>True Blood </i>and <i>Dexter</i>). From the time Tony Soprano waded into his pool to welcome his flock of wayward ducks, it had been clear that viewers were willing to be seduced.</p><p>They were so, in part, because these were also men in recognizable struggle. They belonged to a species you might call Man Beset or Man Harried&#x2014;badgered and bothered and thwarted by the modern world. If there was a signature prop of the era, it was the cell phone, always ringing, rarely at an opportune time and even more rarely with good news. Tony Soprano&#x2019;s jaunty ring tone still provokes a visceral response in anyone who watched the show. When the period prohibited the literal use of cell phone technology, you could see it nonetheless&#x2014;in the German butler trailing an old-fashioned phone after the gangster boss in <i>Boardwalk Empire</i>, or in the poor lackeys charged with delivering news to Al Swearengen, these unfortunate human proxies often bearing the consequences of the same violent wishes Tony seemed to direct to his ever-bleating phone.</p><p>Female characters, too, although most often relegated to supporting roles, were beneficiaries of the new rules of TV: suddenly allowed lives beyond merely being either obstacles or facilitators to the male hero&#x2019;s progress. Instead, they were free to be venal, ruthless, misguided, and sometimes even heroic human beings in their own right&#x2014;the housewife weighing her creature comforts against the crimes she knows her husband commits to provide them, in <i>The Sopranos </i>and<i> Breaking Bad</i>;<i> </i>the prostitute insisting on her dignity by becoming a pimp herself, in <i>Deadwood</i>;<i> </i>the secretary from Bay Ridge battling her way through the testosterone-fueled battlefield of advertising in the 1960s, in <i>Mad Men</i>.</p><p>In keeping with their protagonists, this new generation of shows would feature stories far more ambiguous and complicated than anything that television, always concerned with pleasing the widest possible audience and group of advertisers, had ever seen. They would be narratively ruthless: brooking no quarter for which might be the audience&#x2019;s favorite characters, offering little in the way of catharsis or the easy resolution in which television had traditionally traded.</p><p>It would no longer be safe to assume that everything on your favorite television show would turn out all right&#x2014;or even that the worst wouldn&#x2019;t happen. The sudden death of regular characters, once unthinkable, became such a trope that it launched a kind of morbid parlor game, speculating on who would be next to go. I remember watching, sometime toward the end of the decade, an episode of <i>Dexter</i>&#x2014;a show that took the antihero principle to an all but absurd length by featuring a serial killer as its protagonist&#x2014;in which a poor victim had been strapped to a gurney, sedated, and ritually amputated limb by limb. The thing a viewer feared most, the image that could make one&#x2019;s stomach crawl up his or her rib cage, was that the victim would wake up, realize his plight, and start screaming. Ten years earlier, I would have felt protected from such a sight by the rules and conventions of television; it simply would not happen, because it <i>could not </i>happen. It was a sickening, utterly thrilling sensation to realize that there was no longer any such protection.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Not only were these new kinds of stories, they were being told with a new kind of formal structure. That cable shows had shorter seasons than those on traditional network television&#x2014;twelve or thirteen episodes compared with twenty-two&#x2014;was only the beginning, though by no means unimportant. Thirteen episodes meant more time and care devoted to the writing of each. It meant tighter, more focused serial stories. It meant less financial risk on the part of the network, which translated to more creative risk on-screen.</p><p>The result was a storytelling architecture you could picture as a colonnade&#x2014;each episode a brick with its own solid, satisfying shape, but also part of a season-long arc that, in turn, would stand linked to other seasons to form a coherent, freestanding work of art. (The traditional networks, meanwhile, were rediscovering their love of the exact opposite&#x2014;procedural franchises such as <i>CSI </i>and <i>Law &amp; Order,</i> which featured stand-alone episodes that could be easily rearranged and sold into syndication.) The new structure allowed huge creative freedom: to develop characters over long stretches of time, to tell stories over the course of fifty hours or more, the equivalent of countless movies. </p><p>Indeed, TV has always been reflexively compared with film, but this form of ongoing, open-ended storytelling was, as an oft-used comparison had it, closer to another explosion of high art in a vulgar pop medium: the Victorian serialized novel. That revolution also had been facilitated by upheavals in how stories were created, produced, distributed, and consumed: higher literacy, cheaper printing methods, the rise of a consumer class. Like the new TV, the best of the serials&#x2014;by Dickens, Trollope, George Eliot&#x2014;created suspense through expansive characterization rather than mere cliff-hangers. And like it, too, the new literary form invested in the writer both enormous power (since he or she alone could deliver the coal to keep the narrative train running) and enormous pressure: &#x201c;In writing, or rather publishing periodically, the author has no time to be idle; he must always be lively, pathetic, amusing, or instructive; his pen must never flag&#x2014;his imagination never tire,&#x201d; wrote one contemporary critic in the London <i>Morning Herald.</i> Or as Dickens put it, in journals and letters to friends: &#x201c;I MUST write!&#x201d;</p><p>The result, according to one scholar writing of Dickens&#x2019;s <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>,<i> </i>the first hugely successful serial, certainly sounds familiar: &#x201c;At a single stroke&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something permanent and novel-like was created out of something ephemeral and episodic.&#x201d; Moreover, like the Victorian serialists, the creators of this new television found that the inherent features of their form&#x2014;a vast canvas, intertwining story lines, twists and turns and backtracks in characters&#x2019; progress&#x2014;happened to be singularly equipped not only to fulfill commercial demands, but also to address the big issues of a decadent empire: violence, sexuality, addiction, family, class. These issues became the defining tropes of cable drama. And just like the Victorian writers, TV&#x2019;s auteurs embraced the irony of critiquing a society overwhelmed by industrial consumerism by using precisely that society&#x2019;s most industrialized, consumerist media invention. In many ways, this was TV <i>about</i> what TV had wrought.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>Certainly this was the view of the only man on the fourth floor of Silvercup Studios more crucial to <i>The Sopranos</i>&#x2019;<i> </i>success than its missing star. For all of the show&#x2019;s accomplishments, its creator ...</p></p><h2>Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide (Star Wars Roleplaying Game)</h2><p>A <b><i>Star Wars</i></b>TM <i>Roleplaying Game</i> campaign set during the dawn of the Old Republic...<br><br>Make the jump to lightspeed 4,000 years before the Battle of Yavin to a time when Jedi Knights and Sith Lords clashed in galactic conflict.

Fortunately she didn't take my lapse too seriously or see it as any reflection of my feelings. As for anniversaries and birthdays, I'm a lost cause.

When you love someone, you need to show that love each and every day. Why wait for a certain time of year to bring your wife flowers? Action really does speak louder than words, especially if it's a loving deed, something you do for no particular reason. Except that you want to. Because you care.<br><br>Hannah taught me that. Hannah. A year ago today, May eighth, I lost her, my beautiful thirty-six-year-old wife. Even now, a whole year after her death, I can't think of her without my gut twisting into knots.<br><br>A year. Three hundred and sixty-five lonely days and empty nights.<br><br>A few days after her death, I stood over Hannah's casket and watched as it was lowered into the ground. I threw the first shovelful of dirt into her grave. I'll never forget that sound. The hollow sound of earth hitting the coffin's gleaming surface.<br><br>Not an hour passes that I don't remember Hannah. Actually, that's an improvement. In those first few months, I couldn't keep her out of my head for more than a minute. Everything I saw or heard reminded me of Hannah.<br><br>To simply say I loved her would diminish the depth of my feelings. In every way she completed me. Without her, my world is bleak and colorless and a thousand other adjectives that don't begin to describe the emptiness I've felt since she's been gone.<br><br>I talk to her constantly. I suppose I shouldn't tell people that. We've had this ongoing one-sided conversation from the moment she smiled up at me one last time and surrendered her spirit to God.<br><br>So, here I am a year later, pretending to enjoy the Seattle Mariners' baseball game when all I can think about is my wife. My one-year-dead wife.<br><br>Ritchie, Hannah's brother and my best friend, invited me to share box seats for this game. I'm not fooled. I'm well aware that my brother-in-law didn't include me out of some mistaken belief that I'm an inveterate baseball fan. He knows exactly what anniversary this is.<br><br>I might not be sentimental, but this is one day I <em>can't </em>forget.<br><br>As a physician, a pediatrician, I'm familiar with death. I've witnessed it far too often and it's never easy, especially with children. Even when the end is peaceful and serene as it was with Hannah, I feel I've been cheated, that I've lost.<br><br>As a teenager I was involved in sports. I played football in the fall, basketball in winter and baseball in the spring, and worked as a lifeguard during the summers. The competitive spirit is a natural part of who I am. I don't like to lose, and death, my adversary, doesn't play fair. Death took Hannah from me, from all of us, too early. She was the most vibrant, joyful, loving woman I have ever known. I've been floundering ever since.<br><br>Although I've fought death, my enemy, from the day I became a doctor&#x2014;it's <em>why </em>I became a doctor&#x2014;I learned to understand it in a different, more complex way. I learned death can be a friend even while it's the enemy. As she lay dying, Hannah, who loved me so completely and knew me so well, showed me that ultimate truth.<br><br>A year's time has given me the perspective to realize I did my wife a disservice. My biggest regret is that I refused to accept the fact that she was dying. As a result I held on to her far longer than I should have. I refused to relinquish her when she was ready to leave me. Selfishly, I couldn't bear to let her go.<br><br>Even when she'd drifted into unconsciousness I sat by her bedside night and day, unable to believe that there wouldn't be a miracle. It's stupid; as a medical professional I certainly know better. Yet I clung to her. Now I realize that my stubbornness, my unwillingness to release her to God, held back her spirit. Tied her to earth. To me.<br><br>When I recognized the futility of it all, when I saw what I was doing to Hannah's parents and to Ritchie, I knew I had to let her go. I left Hannah's room and got hold of myself. I hadn't slept in days, hadn't eaten. Nor had I shaved, which means I probably looked even more pathetic than I felt. I went back to our home, showered, forced down a bowl of soup and slept for three uninterrupted hours. When I returned, the immediate family had gathered around her bedside. Hannah's heart rate had slowed and it was only a matter of minutes. Then, just before she died, she opened her eyes, looked directly at me and smiled. I held her hand and raised it to my lips as she closed her eyes and was...gone.<br><br>That last smile will stay with me forever. Every night as I press my head against the pillow, the final image in my mind is Hannah's farewell smile.<br><br>"Hey, Michael. A beer?" Ritchie asked. He doesn't call me Mike; no one does. Even as a kid, I was never a Mike.<br><br>"Sure." My concentration wasn't on the game or on much of anything, really. Without glancing at the scoreboard I couldn't have told you who was ahead. I went through the motions, jumped to my feet whenever Ritchie did. I shouted and made noise along with the rest of the crowd, but I didn't care about the game. I hadn't cared about anything for a long time&#x2014;except my work. That had become my salvation.<br><br>"How about dinner after the game?" Ritchie asked as he handed me a cold beer a few minutes later.<br><br>I hesitated. All that awaited me was an empty house and my memories of Hannah.<br><br>"Sure." I didn't have much of an appetite, though. I rarely did these days.<br><br>"Great." He took a long swig of beer and turned back to the field.<br><br>I hadn't done my brother-in-law any favors by agreeing to attend this game. These weren't cheap seats, either. Ritchie had paid big bucks for box seats behind home plate, and I'd basically ignored the entire game.<br><br>I should've made an excuse and let him take someone else. But I didn't want to be alone. Not today. Every other day of the year I was perfectly content with my own company. But not today.<br><br>The game must have been over because, almost before I was aware of it, people were leaving.<br><br>"Great game," I said, making the effort.<br><br>"We lost," Ritchie muttered.<br><br>I hadn't been paying enough attention to notice.<br><br>Ritchie slapped me on the back and headed out of the stadium. That was his way of telling me he understood.<br><br>Half an hour later we sat in a friendly sports bar not far from Safeco Field. I stared at the menu, wishing I could conjure up an appetite. Over the past year I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. Food was a necessity, and that was the only reason I bothered. I usually ate on the run, without interest or forethought. I needed something in my belly so I grabbed a protein bar or a vegetable drink. It served the purpose, although I derived no pleasure from it.<br><br>Hannah had been exceptionally talented in the kitchen, just like her cousin Winter Adams, who owned the French Cafe on Blossom Street. She loved experimenting with recipes and took pride in preparing meals. Hannah's dinner parties were legendary among our friends. As a hostess, she was a natural&#x2014;charming and gracious.<br><br>"What are you thinking about?" Ritchie asked.<br><br>His question startled me until I saw that he was gazing at the menu. "Grilled salmon," I replied.<br><br>"I'm leaning toward the T-bone," he said.<br><br>I've always associated steaks with celebration, and this wasn't a day I'd consider celebrating. Long before I was willing to accept that Hannah had lost her battle with cancer, she'd told me that when she was gone, she didn't want me to grieve. She said her wake should be as much fun as her parties. At the time I didn't want to hear her talk about death. By then she'd resigned herself to the outcome; I hadn't found the courage to do so.<br><br>The waitress took our order, brought us each a beer and left. I held the amber bottle between my fingers and frowned at the table. I wished I was better company for Ritchie.<br><br>"It's been a year," my brother-in-law murmured. I nodded, acknowledging the comment, but not elaborating on it. "I miss her."<br><br>Again I nodded. As painful as it was to talk about Hannah, I had the burning desire to do exactly that. I wanted&#x2014;no, needed&#x2014;to hold on to her, if not physically, then emotionally.<br><br>"Hard to believe it's been twelve months." I heard the pain in my own voice but didn't try to hide it.<br><br>"You doing okay?" Ritchie asked.<br><br>I shrugged rather than tell the truth&#x2014;I wasn't okay. I was damn mad. Still. How <em>dared </em>this happen to a woman as wonderful as Hannah. How dared it happen to me!<br><br>Hannah and I were married as soon as I graduated from medical school. We decided that my internship and residency would be too demanding to allow us to start a family right away. Hannah worked for a regional department-store chain as a buyer and loved her job. When I'd get home too exhausted to think, she'd entertain me with stories of the people she'd met. People whose names I soon forgot but whose foibles lived on. The smallest incident became a full-fledged anecdote, complete with wickedly funny observations. She had a way of making the most mundane details fascinating. If I close my eyes I can still hear her laugh. I can smile just recalling the early years of our marriage and the struggles we endured, the things we enjoyed. Memories sustained me that first year without Hannah.<br><br>The day I finished my residency and specialized training and was able to join a Seattle practice was the day Hannah threw away her birth control pills. We talked endlessly about our family. I love children and so did Hannah. She wanted three kids; I would've been satisfied with two. Hannah felt an odd number would be best, so I said yes to three.<br><br>But Hannah didn't get pregnant. We'd assumed it would be so easy. She worried constantly, and I was convinced the stress she felt was the real problem. After eighteen months she wanted to see a fertility specialist and I agreed. That was when we learned that getting Hannah pregnant was the very least of our concerns. Within a week of our first visit to the specialist, Hannah was diagnosed with stage-four ovarian cancer. By the time the discovery was made, it was too late to save her.<br><br>I couldn't help feeling I should have known, should have suspected that something wasn't right. As a medical professional, I blamed myself for the fact that Hannah went undiagnosed as long as she did. If I'd paid closer attention, I told myself, I might have picked up on the clues. I'd been busy, preoccupied with work. I had other things on my mind.<br><br>Friends have argued with me, friends like Patrick O'Malley, who's another pediatrician and one of my partners. They frequently reminded me&#x2014;as did Hannah herself&#x2014;that ovarian cancer is notoriously lacking in symptoms until it's too late. I knew all that. What I realized was that I <em>needed </em>to feel guilty, to punish myself; I think I felt better if I could blame myself for not noticing.<br><br>"Remember the night Steph and I had you and Hannah over for dinner?" Ritchie asked, breaking into my thoughts. "The last night?"<br><br>I nodded. It'd been a Friday evening, the final time we'd gone out as a couple. We'd received news that afternoon that had rocked our world. The latest test results had come in&#x2014;and they showed that the chemo had done little to slow the progression of the disease.<br><br>Devastated, I'd wanted to cancel dinner, but Hannah insisted we go. She'd put on a bright smile and walked into her brother and sister-in-law's home as though nothing was wrong. I was an emotional mess and barely made it through the evening. Not Hannah. If I hadn't known, I would never have guessed.<br><br>"Yeah, I remember."<br><br>"She asked me to do something for her that night," Ritchie went on to say.<br><br>"Hannah did?" Unable to hide my surprise, I looked up from my beer.<br><br>Now Ritchie glanced away. "While you were playing a video game with Max, Hannah spoke with me privately."<br><br>I moved to the edge of my seat. The noise from the television blaring above the bar seemed to fade into the background. Every muscle in my body tensed, almost as if I knew what Ritchie was about to tell me.<br><br>"She said the doctors had delivered bad news."<br><br>I focused on an empty bar stool on the other side of the room. "I wanted to cancel dinner. Hannah wouldn't let me."<br><br>"She had a good reason for wanting to come that night," Ritchie explained. "She told me there wasn't any hope left and she'd accepted that she was going to die."<br><br>I wasn't in the mood to hear this. Ritchie exhaled loudly. "She wasn't afraid of dying, you know."<br><br>"Why should she be? Heaven was made for people like Hannah."<br><br>Ritchie nodded, agreeing with me. "She'd made her peace with God long before that night. She never had a fatalistic attitude. She wanted to live. More than anything, she wanted to live."<br><br>At one time I'd doubted that. "I begged her to let me take her to Europe because I'd read about an experimental treatment there. She wouldn't go."<br><br>"It was too late," Ritchie said simply. His hand tightened around the beer bottle. "She knew it even if we didn't."<br><br>That was Hannah&#x2014;not only was she wise, but forever practical. While she was willing to accept the inevitable, I clung to every shred of hope. I spent hours studying medical journals, calling specialists, doing online research. But my crazed efforts to cure her didn't make any difference. In the end Hannah had been right; she'd reached the point of no return. She died less than two months later.<br><br>Even now I was shocked by how quickly she slipped away. It was the only time in our marriage that I became truly angry with her. I wanted Hannah to fight the cancer. I shouted and paced and slammed my fist against the wall. Gently she took my bleeding knuckles between her own hands and kissed away the pain. What she didn't seem to understand was that no amount of tenderness would ease the ache of her leaving me.<br><br></p><h2>Into The Fire</h2><p>There is a secret hidden within a body, burning within the flames, that will change history forever. 2014: In the French city of Orleans, a man&#39;s charred corpse is found in a burned-out hotel, stripped of all ID.

No crowded malls, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That&#x2019;s just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they&#x2019;ll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on Hemlock Street without a rooftop Frosty; they won&#x2019;t be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren&#x2019;t even going to have a tree. They won&#x2019;t need one, because come December 25 they&#x2019;re setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences&#x2013;and isn&#x2019;t half as easy as they&#x2019;d imagined. <br><br>A classic tale for modern times, <i>Skipping Christmas</i> offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that have become part of our holiday tradition.</p><p>John Grisham turns a satirical eye on the overblown ritual of the festive holiday season, and the result is <i>Skipping Christmas</i>, a modest but funny novel about the tyranny of December 25. Grisham's story revolves around a typical middle-aged American couple, Luther and Nora Krank. On the first Sunday after Thanksgiving they wave their daughter Blair off to Peru to work for the Peace Corps, and they suddenly realize that "for the first time in her young and sheltered life Blair would spend Christmas away from home."<p> Luther Krank sees his daughter's Christmas absence as an opportunity. He estimates that "a year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas," and have "precious little to show for it." So he makes an executive decision, telling his wife, friends, and neighbors that "we won't do Christmas." Instead, Luther books a 10-day Caribbean cruise. But things start to turn nasty when horrified neighbors get wind of the Krank's subversive scheme and besiege the couple with questions about their decision.</p><p> Grisham builds up a funny but increasingly terrifying picture of how this tight-knit community turns on the Kranks, who find themselves under increasing pressure to conform. As the tension mounts, readers may wonder whether they will manage to board their plane on Christmas day. <i>Skipping Christmas</i> is Grisham-lite, with none of the serious action or drama of his legal thrillers, but a funny poke at the craziness of Christmas. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>This is a limited edition, cloth bound book, that is signed by the author and numbered.

In addition to providing known etymology and usage, entries explore how meaning varies by social context or circumstance, and how it has changed over time. Many include brief quotations from recent writings. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>The juxtaposition of ethnicities in the United States has had many repercussions, and confusion has plagued the scene. And, as with all issues of conflict, language can serve to clear up or further muddy the waters. In the interests of clarity, Philip Herbst has taken a scholarly, unbiased approach to bias, defining more than 850 ethnic and racial terms, including etymology, development, and connotations. From "Abie" to "Zulu," with slurs of nearly every U.S. ethnic group, ethnic euphemisms, and key terms in multicultural debates, <i>The Color of Words</i> provides the wherewithal to understand the politics of language and the language of racial politics.This combination multicultural encyclopedia and dictionary of terms associated with racial discrimination offers a contemporary look at ethnic usage. More than a simple slang dictionary, it incorporates common yet misunderstood terms ("Hispanic," "Native American"), ethnic slurs affecting a wide group of American minorities, and politically driven words and phrases ("ethnic cleansing," "politically correct"). Entries begin with one or more definitions followed by known etymology and usage; social background and implications are often included. A writer and editor trained as an anthropologist, Herbst has created a balanced, scholarly treatment of intercultural communication. Used in conjunction with works treating a single ethnic culture (e.g., Juba to Jive: A Dictionary of African-American Slang, LJ 1/94), this work will help define the language of cultural relations A useful reference for both academic and public libraries.?Kelli Perkins, Herrick P.L., Holland, Mich.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Your Voice An Inside View</h2><p>Praised for its clarity, readability, and the depth of its content, McCoy&#39;s Your Voice: An Inside View has become one of the most frequently used pedagogic resources in the United States, Canada, and abroad.

This is his first book.Chapter 1<br>The container swayed as the crane hoisted it onto the ship. The spreader, which hooks the container to the crane, was unable to control its movement, so it seemed to float in the air. The hatches, which had been improperly closed, suddenly sprang open, and dozens of bodies started raining down. They looked like mannequins. But when they hit the ground, their heads split open, as if their skulls were real. And they were. Men, women, even a few children, came tumbling out of the container. All dead. Frozen, stacked one on top of another, packed like sardines. These were the Chinese who never die. The eternal ones, who trade identity papers among themselves. So this is where they&#x2019;d ended up, the bodies that in the wildest fantasies might have been cooked in Chinese restaurants, buried in fields beside factories, or tossed into the mouth of Vesuvius. Here they were. Spilling from the container by the dozen, their names scribbled on tags and tied with string around their necks. They&#x2019;d all put aside money so they could be buried in China, back in their hometowns, a percentage withheld from their salaries to guarantee their return voyage once they were dead. A space in a container and a hole in some strip of Chinese soil. The port crane operator covered his face with his hands as he told me about it, eyeing me through his fingers. As if the mask of his hands might give him the courage to speak. He&#x2019;d seen the bodies fall, but there&#x2019;d been no need to sound the alarm. He merely lowered the container to the ground, and dozens of people appeared out of nowhere to put everyone back inside and hose down the remains. That&#x2019;s how it went. He still couldn&#x2019;t believe it and hoped he was hallucinating, due to too much overtime. Then he closed his fingers, completely covering his eyes. He kept on whimpering, but I couldn&#x2019;t understand what he was saying.<br>Everything that exists passes through here. Through the port of Naples. There&#x2019;s not a product, fabric, piece of plastic, toy, hammer, shoe, screwdriver, bolt, video game, jacket, pair of pants, drill, or watch that doesn&#x2019;t come through the port. The port of Naples is an open wound. The end point for the interminable voyage that merchandise makes. Ships enter the gulf and come to the dock like babies to the breast, except that they&#x2019;re here to be milked, not fed. The port of Naples is the hole in the earth out of which what&#x2019;s made in China comes. The Far East, as reporters still like to call it. Far. Extremely far. Practically unimaginable. Closing my eyes, I see kimonos, Marco Polo&#x2019;s beard, Bruce Lee kicking in midair. But in fact this East is more closely linked to the port of Naples than to any other place. There&#x2019;s nothing far about the East here. It should be called the extremely near East, the least East. Everything made in China is poured out here. Like a bucket of water dumped into a hole in the sand. The water eats the sand, and the hole gets bigger and deeper. The port of Naples handles 20 percent of the value of Italian textile imports from China, but more than 70 percent of the quantity. It&#x2019;s a bizarre thing, hard to understand, yet merchandise possesses a rare magic: it manages both to be and not to be, to arrive without ever reaching its destination, to cost the customer a great deal despite its poor quality, and to have little tax value in spite of being worth a huge amount. Textiles fall under quite a few product classifications, and a mere stroke of the pen on the shipping manifest can radically lower price and VAT. In the silence of the port&#x2019;s black hole, the molecular structure of merchandise seems to break down, only to recompose once it gets beyond the perimeter of the coast. Goods have to leave the port immediately. Everything happens so quickly that they disappear in the process, evaporate as if they&#x2019;d never existed. As if nothing had happened, as if it had all been simply an act. An imaginary voyage, a false landing, a phantom ship, evanescent cargo. Goods need to arrive in the buy-er&#x2019;s hands without leaving any drool to mark their route, they have to reach their warehouse quickly, right away, before time can even begin&#x2014;time that might allow for an inspection. Hundreds of pounds of merchandise move as if they were a package hand-delivered by the mailman. In the port of Naples&#x2014;330 acres spread out along seven miles of coastline&#x2014;time undergoes unique expansions and contractions. Things that take an hour elsewhere seem to happen here in less than a minute. Here the proverbial slowness that makes the Neapolitan&#x2019;s every move molasses-like is quashed, confuted, negated. The ruthless swiftness of Chinese merchandise overruns the temporal dimension of customs inspections, killing time itself. A massacre of minutes, a slaughter of seconds stolen from the records, chased by trucks, hurried along by cranes, helped by forklifts that disembowel the containers.<br>COSCO, the largest Chinese state-owned shipping company, with the world&#x2019;s third-largest fleet, operates in the port of Naples in consort with MSC, a Geneva-based company that owns the world&#x2019;s second-largest commercial fleet. The Swiss and Chinese decided to pool together and invest heavily in Naples, where they manage the largest cargo terminal. With over 3,000 feet of pier, nearly a million and a half square feet of terminal, and more than 300,000 square feet of outdoor space at their disposal, they absorb almost all the traffic in transit for Europe. You have to reconfigure your imagination to try to understand the port of Naples as the bottom rung of the ladder of Chinese production. The biblical image seems appropriate: the eye of the needle is the port, and the camel that has to pass through it are the ships. Enormous vessels line up single file out in the gulf and await their turn amid the confusion of pitching sterns and colliding bows; rumbling with heaving iron, the sheet metal and screws slowly penetrate the tiny Neapolitan opening. It is as if the anus of the sea were opening out, causing great pain to the sphincter muscles.<br>But no. It&#x2019;s not like that. There&#x2019;s no apparent confusion. The ships all come and go in orderly fashion, or at least that&#x2019;s how it looks from dry land. Yet 150,000 containers pass through here every year. Whole cities of merchandise get built on the quays, only to be hauled away. A port is measured by its speed, and every bureaucratic sluggishness, every meticulous inspection, transforms the cheetah of transport into a slow and lumbering sloth.<br>I always get lost on the pier. Bausan pier is like something made out of LEGO blocks. An immense construction that seems not so much to occupy space as to invent it. One corner looks like it&#x2019;s covered with wasps&#x2019; nests. An entire wall of bastard beehives: thousands of electrical outlets that feed the &#x201c;reefers,&#x201d; or refrigerator containers. All the TV dinners and fish sticks in the world are crammed into these icy containers. At Bausan pier I feel as if I&#x2019;m seeing the port of entry for all the merchandise that mankind produces, where it spends its last night before being sold. It&#x2019;s like contemplating the origins of the world. The clothes young Parisians will wear for a month, the fish sticks that Brescians will eat for a year, the watches Catalans will adorn their wrists with, and the silk for every English dress for an entire season&#x2014;all pass through here in a few hours. It would be interesting to read someplace not just where goods are manufactured, but the route they take to land in the hands of the buyer. Products have multiple, hybrid, and illegitimate citizenship. Half-born in the middle of China, they&#x2019;re finished on the outskirts of some Slavic city, brought to perfection in northeastern Italy, packaged in Puglia or north of Tirana in Albania, and finally end up in a warehouse somewhere in Europe. No human being could ever have the rights of mobility that merchandise has. Every fragment of the journey, with its accidental and official routes, finds its fixed point in Naples. When the enormous container ships first enter the gulf and slowly approach the pier, they seem like lumbering mammoths of sheet metal and chains, the rusted sutures on their sides oozing water; but when they berth, they become nimble creatures. You&#x2019;d expect these ships to carry a sizable crew, but instead they disgorge handfuls of little men who seem incapable of taming these brutes on the open ocean.<br>The first time I saw a Chinese vessel dock, I felt as if I were looking at the production of the whole world. I was unable to count the containers, to quantify them. I couldn&#x2019;t keep track of them all. It might seem absurd not to be able to put a number on things, but I kept losing count, the figures were too big and got mixed up in my head.<br>These days the merchandise unloaded in Naples is almost exclusively Chinese&#x2014;1.6 million tons annually. Registered merchandise, that is. At least another million tons pass through without leaving a trace. According to the Italian Customs Agency, 60 percent of the goods arriving in Naples escape official customs inspection, 20 percent of the bills of entry go unchecked, and fifty thousand shipments are contraband, 99 percent of them from China&#x2014;all for an estimated 200 million euros in evaded taxes each semester. The containers that need to disappear before being inspected are in the first row. Every container is duly numbered, but the numbers on many of them are identical. So one inspected container baptizes all the illegal ones with the same number. What gets unloaded on Monday can be for sale in Modena or Genoa or in the shop windows of Bonn or Munich by Thursday. Lots of merchandise on the Italian market is supposedly only in transit, but the magic of customs makes transit stationary. The grammar of merchandise has one syntax for documents and another for commerce. In April 2005, the Antifraud unit of Italian Customs, which had by chance launched four separate operations nearly simultaneously, sequestered 24,000 pairs of jeans intended for the French market; 51,000 items from Bangladesh labeled &#x201c;Made in Italy&#x201d;; 450,000 figurines, puppets, Barbies, and Spider-men; and another 46,000 plastic toys&#x2014;for a total value of approximately 36 million euros. Just a small serving of the economy that was making its way through the port of Naples in a few hours. And from the port to the world. On it goes, all day, every day. These slices of the economy are becoming a staple diet.<br>The port is detached from the city. An infected appendix, never quite degenerating into peritonitis, always there in the abdomen of the coastline. A desert hemmed in by water and earth, but which seems to belong to neither land nor sea. A grounded amphibian, a marine metamorphosis. A new formation created from the dirt, garbage, and odds and ends that the tide has carried ashore over the years. Ships empty their latrines and clean their holds, dripping yellow foam into the water; motorboats and yachts, their engines belching, tidy up by tossing everything into the garbage can that is the sea. The soggy mass forms a hard crust all along the coastline. The sun kindles the mirage of water, but the surface of the sea gleams like trash bags. Black ones. The gulf looks percolated, a giant tub of sludge. The wharf with its thousands of multicolored containers seems an uncrossable border: Naples is encircled by walls of merchandise. But the walls don&#x2019;t defend the city; on the contrary, it&#x2019;s the city that defends the walls. Yet there are no armies of longshoremen, no romantic riffraff at the port. One imagines it full of commotion, men coming and going, scars and incomprehensible languages, a frenzy of people. Instead, the silence of a mechanized factory reigns. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anyone around anymore, and the containers, ships, and trucks seem animated by perpetual motion. A silent swiftness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerpted from Gomorrah by Roberto Saviano. Copyright � 2007 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., Milan Translation copyright � 2007 by Virginia Jewiss.

Easily. Maybe ten years.&#39; Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club Following a near fatal overdose of painkillers, Daniel Fletcher is resuscitated in a Los Angeles emergency room and detained for psychiatric evaluation. Through a series of questions and tests, the psychiatrist must ascertain whether the patient intended to kill himself, or whether he can walk free. What the psychiatrist doesn&#39;t know is that &#39;Daniel Fletcher&#39; is actually John - Johnny - Dolan Vincent, a brilliant young forger who continually changes his identity to save himself from a lifetime of incarceration. Johnny has done such assessments before - many, many times. As he creates an elaborate bluff for the evaluator, Johnny reveals the true story of his traumatic past - a broken family, descent into the sinister world of forgers and criminals, and his one chance of salvation in the beautiful and elusive Molly. But time is running out; as his underworld clients lose patience and the psychiatrist&#39;s net closes around him, Johnny has to negotiate the escape act of his life. Evoking the boulevards and strip bars of 1980s LA with cinematic intensity, The Contortionist&#39;s Handbook is a darkly hypnotic and stunningly original debut.</p><p>Craig Clevenger was born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Southern California, where he studied English at California State University, Long Beach. He has travelled extensively and lived in Dublin and London, but currently resides in California where he is at work on his second novel, Dermaphoria.Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as "The Evaluator," who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network. The trouble is that Clevenger has little to offer to push his story forward besides Vincent's efforts to protect Keadra, the woman he falls in love with during a hospital stint, from the thugs who are trying to track him down. Clevenger is a solid writer who does some good work when it comes to creating a noirish atmosphere and smart, compelling characters, but the pace is uneven at best. The quality of the writing warrants a follow-up effort; hopefully, Clevenger will know what to do with his characters the next time around.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Plover</h2><p>Declan O Donnell has sailed out of Oregon and deep into the vast, wild ocean, having finally had enough of other people and their problems. He will go it alone, he will be his own country, he will be beholden to and beloved of no one. No man is an island, my butt, he thinks. I am that very man . . .</p><p>Brian Doyle (1956-2017) was the longtime editor of Portland Magazine at the University of Portland, in Oregon. His work includes six collections of essays, two nonfiction books, a short story collection, and the novels Mink River, The Plover, Chicago, and The Adventures of John Carson in Several Quarters of the World.I <br>45� NORTH, 125� WEST <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>WEST AND THEN WEST for weeks and weeks or months and months sweet Jesus knows how long. A lifetime of lifetimes. On the continent of the sea. A pair of shaggy claws scuttling on the ceiling of the sea. The silent She. <br>West and then west! says Declan aloud, startling the gull sitting atop the <i>Plover</i>&#x2019;s tiny cabin, her feathers ruffling in the steady wind. Onward twisted soldiers! The gull launches without the slightest effort, sliding into the welcoming air. Declan laughs. Go ahead, bird, assume the position, he says, and as if in obedience to the man&#x2019;s command the gull wheels behind and over the stern and hangs exactly nine feet above the boat without even a shiver of her wings. Sweet Jesus, says Declan, I would ask you how you <i>do</i> that, but you know and I know that there are more things than we know, as you know. Onward whiskered soldiers! <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The <i>Plover,</i> out of Oregon, skippered by O Donnell, Declan, no fixed address or abode. Last registered midcoast, in Depoe Bay. Originally a small trawler, much amended and edited by its owner, who installed a mast and rigged the boat for coastal cruising. Wrecked once near Neawanaka, minor damage, repaired by owner. For some years a fishing boat bringing in regular catches, occasional permits filed for charter fishing, one permit filed for whale-watching cruise, a number of gratuitous permit applications filed in last three years apparently for the amusement of the owner: for flossing the teeth of unsuspecting whales, in search of Robert Dean Frisbie on account of incontrovertible evidence of his faked demise in the South Seas, in pursuit of the magnetic West Pole, in search of the names of god in the languages of the invertebrates west of the Mendocino Fracture Zone and east of the Emperor Seamounts, and etc. in that vein. Flurries and then blizzards of permit applications filed in the last six months, each more fanciful than the last. Last seen heading directly west from Oregon coast. Captain reportedly stated that he was going to &#x201c;glom on to the 45th parallel and ride that sucker right onto the beach of some godforsaken island being bickered over by the Japanese and the Russians and claim it anew for Saint Mary Magdalene while none of the formerly murderous imperial powers were paying close attention.&#x201d; Also heard stating that he was going to &#x201c;turn sharp left at 150 degrees longitude and snatch a Society island, naming it fresh for Saint Catherine of Siena, why should bold imperialism die ignominiously during my brief lifetime, and there were not enough celebrations of and monuments to Catherine of Siena, fine woman, twenty-fourth of twenty-five children, who are we not to sing her praises assiduously with gratuitous acts of theatrical foolery,&#x201d; and etc. in that vein. Conclusion: no destination known. Coast Guard reports no sightings. U.S. Navy Pacific Command alerted. General marine bulletin posted. To be considered lost at sea pending further information if any. Notice of same sent to next of kin. No estate. Three survivors, a sister of age and two minor brothers. No plans for funeral or memorial at this time. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>What&#x2019;s on board: two hundred gallons of fuel, stashed in every conceivable nook and cranny. One hundred pounds of rice. Magellan survived on rice and so dammit will we. More onions and heads of garlic than a man can count in an hour, as I well know, having tried. A man is like an onion, is he not, a layered and reeking thing? Fifty boxes of cookies, fifty lemons, fifty limes. An enormous tin of marmalade. Fifty oranges. An enormous tin of olive oil. Fifty small bags of almonds scattered variously throughout the vessel so that a man will constantly be discovering a small bag of almonds no matter where he is on board, good idea, hey? Element of surprise, hey? Not that there is all that much board on board, or surprise neither. Twenty feet long by eight feet wide by seven feet deep. The size of a roomy coffin. But few coffins have fifty limes aboard, hey? Life raft, life jacket, foul-weather gear, medical kit, complete set of spare parts for engine, complete set of tools for fixing the fecking engine, complete set of fishing gear. One, two, six, seven, why do I have seven fishing rods? Radio, charts, graphs, sextant, compass, flashlights, soap, baseball bat (Dick Groat model), set of Edmund Burke&#x2019;s speeches, sails, rigging, backup sails, backup rigging, a trumpet, excellent knives, bow and arrows? Who the hell put a bow and arrows on board? I don&#x2019;t remember putting a bow and arrows on board. Am I losing it already? A bow and arrows&nbsp;&#x2026; what am I going to do with a bow and arrows, shoot flying fish? Sweet Jesus. Binoculars, backup binoculars, mirrors, sounding lead and string, flares, pencils, batteries for flashlights, sweet Jesus, arrows, I cannot believe I am shipping arrows, is that even legal? Am I considered armed? Can I get pulled over by the fecking Coast Guard and busted for harboring unregistered weapons? What is this, the fecking age of Magellan? Almanac. And, most important of all, boys and girls, your six-volume set of sight reduction tables! Never leave home without it! Because why? Because sight reduction tables are your handy solutions to problems of spherical trigonometry, which is to say problems in observed latitudes, celestial declinations, and computation of your azimuth! Exactly! The azimuth is <i>important</i>! Also do not leave home without Edmund Burke&#x2019;s speeches. Burke is <i>important</i>. Burke is an ocean whose depths are in general unplumbed. Everyone thinks they know what Burke said and wrote and meant and means and no one has the slightest idea what he actually wrote because no one fecking reads old Edmund Burke anymore but <i>I</i> will address and redress this problem. <i>I</i> am going to read old Ed Burke, because <i>I</i> have the time, because <i>I</i> am on a voyage to nowhere, and in no hurry to get there neither. <br>Bird! says Declan aloud, startling the gull surfing effortlessly above the stern, are you in this for the long haul? Because if so I&#x2019;ll have to edit the crew manifest, and we&#x2019;ll have to talk about shares of the proceeds and stuff like that. Hey, can you calculate sight reduction tables? <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The Peaceful Sea, Fern�o de Magalh�es called the Pacific, when he wandered into it for the first time in 1520, in his ship the <i>Trinidad</i>&#x2014;a caravel, a two-masted ship. The South Sea, Vasco N��ez de Balboa called it when he saw it for the first time, in 1513 (and promptly asserted ownership of the entire ocean and all lands encroaching upon it). The Panthalassic Ocean, scholars call the Pacific&#x2019;s predecessor, the ocean of the world when the world was young. The Endless, some early and brave travelers called it, people who sailed by the stars. The Mother, other old cultures called it, in their various languages. It is the biggest ocean on earth and perhaps in the universe. It is about half of the wildernesses we call oceans on this planet. It composes about a third of the surface of the earth. Some parts of it are more than six miles deep. On average it is about two miles deep. It weighs about eighty quintillion tons, an idea represented by an eight followed by eighteen zeroes. In the hundred thousand years or so that human beings have been exploring the Endless, we have discovered some two hundred thousand species of animals and plants living and working in it, which some of us believe to be perhaps a tenth of the actual animals and plants in it, the rest of those beings not having revealed themselves to us as yet. If it is true that human beings in our current form rose in Africa, and then ambled briskly into the rest of the world, there must have been a moment when one human being, probably a curious and mischievous child, peeked through a fringe of forest, perhaps on a high hill, and saw the biggest blue thing on earth and perhaps in the universe. Imagine that scene for a moment: the child&#x2019;s gape, the thrumming roar of the ocean, the child&#x2019;s thrill and terror, the shock and allure of encountering a thing far bigger than the imagination had previously stretched. Imagine that child&#x2019;s wide eyes and sizzling brain. Imagine the message imparted to his mother by the fire that night. Imagine <i>that.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>On this voyage, this particular jaunt, this epic adventure, this bedraggled expedition, this foolish flight, this seashamble, this muddled maundering, this aimless amble on the glee of the sea, we will navigate not by what&#x2019;s <i>in</i> the ocean, which is elemental but really <i>in</i>cidental if you take the long view, but by the wilderness of the bottom, which is&nbsp;&#x2026; fundamental, so to speak, says Declan to the floating gull, who appears to be paying close attention. In my view the <i>water</i> of the ocean is essentially fascist, trying to dictate all life and action by weight and violence, whereas what is beneath it, the bones, the skeleton, the actual warm skin of the planet, is generally unremarked, unsung, unknown, but, as a population is the foundation for a government, the bedrock, the necessary and patient mattress for what sprawls upon it, so to speak. So a real journey into the Pacific ought to steer by the mountains below; and wouldn&#x2019;t that show more respect for the planet we are actually <i>on,</i> rather than steering by the light of stars we will never actually see? Are you with me here, bird? Why should water have the last word, you know what I mean? Let&#x2019;s take the long view. Let&#x2019;s forget the past and keep an eye on the horizon. Let&#x2019;s think of this as an expedition of inquiry, during which a man, let us say a former dairyman and sometime fisherman, sails west and then west, curious about seamounts and fracture zones, and vast epic valleys into which light has never penetrated since the dawn of time, and caves and intricate wildernesses in which reside creatures never seen by the eye of man or gull, and soaring mountains on which live ancient eels and squid the size of ships, and he conducts experiments into fauna and flora as such opportunities present themselves, and earns his protein with his longlines, dipping into ship&#x2019;s stores only for the occasional lime, doing his best to avoid demon alcohol which has never served him well, and keeping an eye on the shape of his sanity, such as it is, or was, and leery of such things as talking freely to gulls, for example, which may be a sign of incipient something or other. You with me here, bird? <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Neither the <i>Plover</i> nor its master had the slightest initial experience with sails and masts and rigging and wind management, but Declan, having dreamed of a footloose voyage on the ocean since he was the boy who tripped over a ratty rug in the library and fell facefirst into <i>Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft,</i> by Thor Heyerdahl (followed in dizzying succession by Robert Gibbings&#x2019;s <i>Over the Reefs</i> and <i>Coconut Island,</i> and James Norman Hall&#x2019;s <i>Faery Lands of the South Seas</i> and <i>Under a Thatched Roof,</i> and Jack London&#x2019;s <i>South Sea Tales,</i> and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s <i>In the South Seas,</i> and Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s <i>Typhoon</i> and <i>Youth,</i> and <i>The Journals of Captain James Cook,</i> and Captain David Porter&#x2019;s <i>Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean,</i> and Richard Maury&#x2019;s <i>The Saga of Cimba,</i> and Herman Melville&#x2019;s <i>Typee,</i> and Edward Frederick Knight&#x2019;s <i>The Cruise of the Falcon,</i> and <i>The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss,</i> and then literally hundreds of books about the islands west and south of his muddy tense pained angry lonely home in the rain), had bought the old trawler when he was seventeen, from an old man who built it half-size because he had half the money he needed half his life ago and only used it half the time now that he was half the man he used to be. Declan then used it for fishing the near coast, generally for salmon and halibut; but always in the back of the back of his mind, tucked away beyond conscious thought, was the irrepressible idea of someday heading west and then west, for no particular reason, just to see what he could see; and so he had edited and amended the boat slowly and idiosyncratically over the years, adding a mast and standing and running rigging so as to use the wind wherever and whenever possible, thus saving gobs of fuel, and becoming familiar with such mysterious and obdurate words as batten and clew, and luff and leech, and toggle and tang, and reaching and running, although the <i>Plover</i> did not do overmuch reaching and running, more like shuffling and shambling, as Declan said, not without a deep affection for the old cedar creature. He built a simple hoist for the engine, and a cedar weather box for the engine to sleep in, for when the <i>Plover</i> had sails on, in winds that looked like they might last; and when razzed by other fishermen, and by the weekend sailors in Newport and Depoe Bay who laughed aloud at the little trawler with its mast like a grade-school flagpole and its sails made of old kitchen towels, as a wit from Waldport sneered, Declan thought happily of all the fuel he was not expending, and gave everyone the cheerful finger; his usual digitous discourse. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>And no <i>thinking</i> on this trip, either, he said to the gull floating over the stern. No recriminations and ruminations. No logs and journals and literary pretensions neither. Thinking can only, like the boat, proceed forward. We can only think west. Sweet blessed Jesus. Four days out and I am already talking to a fecking gull. Why are you here, exactly, bird? What&#x2019;s in it for you? Because there&#x2019;s not a whole lot of food available here, my friend. This is a working boat. Everyone on or over the boat has to work for a living. That&#x2019;s why I am fishing for my supper, and no, you cannot have half, although yes, you can have the head and tail and innards. Did you <i>want</i> to be going west and then west? Because that is where we are going until further notice. And what are <i>you</i> doing on behalf of the boat, may I ask? Are you providing some rudderly service that I am as yet not aware of? Are you protecting the boat in some mysterious capacity? And don&#x2019;t give me any of this spiritual crap. And don&#x2019;t get all literary on me either, talismans and metaphors and symbols and crap like that. You are most definitely not a metaphor, my friend. <i>You</i> are a herring gull and this is a boat and I am the guy on the boat. It&#x2019;s that simple. You are no albatross and I am no ancient mariner. I read my classics. In fact I vow that if an albatross ever hangs in exactly the same position you are hanging in right now I will strike myself three times on the breast and intone prayers and imprecations. This I swear. You are welcome to hang there as long as you want but don&#x2019;t steal anything. I cast no aspersions on gull people. I am just laying out the rules. Maybe you are unlike all the other gulls who ever lived and you are the first one who won&#x2019;t steal whatever he or she can at the drop of a fecking hat. In which case we will get along fine. If that is not the case and you steal anything from the boat I will catch your raggedy ass and cut you into filets and savor each and every gullicious bite. Are we clear here? On this boat there are no gray areas. There are no misunderstandings. There are no misapprehensions. There are no infinitesimal gradations of emotions and feelings. No one makes mistakes as regards anyone else. There <i>is</i> no anyone else. There&#x2019;s no past and there&#x2019;s no future. We are stripping it all down here, my friend.

The Allied invasion, bringing the promise of Liberation, is awaited, eagerly and nervously. The Vichy regime is in its death throes. Those who have served it and collaborated with the German Occupation fear the revenge of the Resistance. Atrocities are committed on both sides, and justice is blind. Superintendent Lannes, suspended from duty by order of the Boches, searches unofficially for a missing girl, and investigates cases of historic sex abuse. His marriage is experiencing difficulties and he worries about his sons, one with the Free French, the other in Vichy. The narrative of this tense economical novel switches between Lannes in Bordeaux and the young characters met in the first three books of this Vichy Quartet, now caught up in the terrible drama of these months - in France, London and on the Eastern Front - and brings Allan Massie&#39;s acclaimed series to its gripping climax.</p><p>Allan Massie is the author of twenty novels including the critically acclaimed World War II trilogy: A Question of Loyalties, The Sins of the Father, and Shadows of Empire.

After teaming up with two renegades in the Deep, Will discovers that the Styx are planning to kill all of the humans living Topsoil so that the Colony can reclaim the Earth.

Thoroughly explaining the benefits of a diet that emphasizes foods low on the glycemic index -- that produce a low, slow blood-sugar response -- The Glucose Revolution shows how to get the most out of this exciting new resource.</p><p>At last, a diet book based on sound scientific research! <i>The Glucose Revolution: The Authoritative Guide to the Glycemic Index--The Groundbreaking Medical Discovery</i>, is written by respected Australian and Canadian nutrition experts, including two MDs and a Ph.D., who've spent the past 20 years researching the role of carbohydrates in a healthy diet. According to the authors, watching carbohydrate consumption is the key to a healthy diet. There's good reason the book has been endorsed by biggies in the medical field like Harvard's Dr. JoAnn Manson and integrative health guru Dr. Andrew Weil: the authors are acknowledged in the medical community as leading authorities on the topic and have published hundreds of articles in scientific journals before translating their findings here for us regular folks. <p> But, say the authors, not all carbs are created equal, which is where the glycemic index comes in. A ranking of carbs based on how quickly they're broken down during digestion and their effects on blood sugar (glucose) levels, the index is culled from 15 years of studies involving hundreds of people. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index, such as bread and potatoes, are quickly digested and released into the bloodstream as glucose. They provide an immediate energy boost, but aren't filling enough to sustain you till your next meal. Carbs with a low glycemic index, such as rolled oats and pasta, slowly release glucose into the bloodstream, are more satisfying, and better help to control hunger.</p><p> Part one of the book provides the scientific--but highly readable--explanation of what comprises a healthy, balanced diet. Part two provides specific recommendations for people looking to lose weight without feeling hungry all the time, athletes seeking energy to fuel their workouts, and people with diabetes who need to carefully control their blood sugar. This section also contains 50 easy-to-prepare recipes for meals and snacks, with a glycemic index ranking and fat, calorie, carbohydrate, and fiber counts. <i>--Nancy Monson</i></p>Associate Professor Jennie Brand Miller is head of the teaching and research staff of the Human Nutrition Unit at the University of Sydney.

He has taught writing and literature at Cornell University and at the City University of New York. His many honours include two first place O&#39;Henry Awards.Brodkey's long, long, long-awaited first novel that could not possibly live up to expectations--and yet, largely, does. One must forgive Brodkey or oneself for not being able to take in every page of this 800-page novel with equal thirst. Tedious passages, reread later, spring to life--and some remain tiresome (for now). The story focuses on the childhood, youth, and first marriage (not in that order!) of Wiley Silenowicz, a Missouri genius, and the role of his hideously vile-tempered sister Nonie as a shadow in all people Wiley meets or marries. Earlier sketches seen in Stories in an Almost Classical Mode (1988) are mere charcoal prefigurings of what appears here--and seem pared and objective set beside the bathyspheric subjectivity of the novel. The plot?--a psychic web of small electrical events feeding and racing everywhere, and never stated formally. Nothing happens now: every action arrives through a veil, often at merciless length. Wiley, at two, has been adopted by S.L. and Lila of St. Louis, who have a blood-daughter, Nonie, 11 years older than Wiley. Nonie, who must give pain to be alive, rules the roost, and we follow her demonic life until her death by fire in her early 40s (Wiley tells this story, a hugely askew elegy, nearly 20 years after her death). Events include baby sensations as S.L. lifts up Wiley and walks about filling him with fatherly advice; Lila's fabulous car accident as she forgetfully drives her Buick into a bus, flees on three-inch heels wearing a fox neckpiece; masturbation solo and in tandem; vast sex scenes, one at 14, his first coupling (almost), which is forever interrupted by Nonie, and a later sexfest with his deliberately inorgasmic wife Ora; trips with a homosexual older cousin; and separate death-scenes for S.L. and Lila, which spread all over the novel. Forget the Proust comparison. Brodkey is himself, and many pages here have the deep-rolling profound thrust, painterly originality, and lightning-bolt flash of great art. But many readers will fade early. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Bush&#39;s administration. The book is a collection of work, some consisting of relevant poems drawn from his Vietnam era book, &#34;The Light Around the Body&#34;, (a National Book Award winner), and some new work specifically addressing &#34;the rapacious soul&#34; and its greedy longings.</p><p></p><h2>Someone Could Win a Polar Bear</h2><p>Boyds Mills Press publishes a wide range of high-quality fiction and nonfiction picture books, chapter books, novels, and nonfiction</p><p>John Ciardi's collection of 35 poems with drawings by Edward Gorey is perhaps the best known book with this title (published in 1962); it, too, used the concept of dividing a poem on the page, designed for a more experienced reader to read with a child. Hoberman (One of Each) here creates a collection of 12 rhyming and heavily repetitious dialogues, each one ending with the emphasis on reading together (e.g., "I'll read to you. You'll read to me"; "We'll read together,/ You and I"). In "The Dime," a pig discovers that the coin he found may actually be the lost money of his rabbit friend. A discussion ensues: "Shall we divide the dime in two?"/ "A nickel each? It's up to you."/ Or shall we buy/ One thing to share?"/ "That would be fun, that would fair." Another playful poem, "The Bear," takes on an incredulous tone; when a boy's little brother tells a bear he can spend the night as long as he does not snore, the boy's friend replies, "Your little brother/ Sounds quite brave/ To tell a bear/ How to behave." But while the mood is light, the text never really takes flight. In addition to similar phrases, the rhyme scan is nearly identical in all of the poems; the tone becomes monotonous. However, each of Emberley's (Happy Birth Day!) spot illustrations is unique and, in total, the artwork creates relationships among the characters. Working in watercolor, pen and pastel, he endows his characters with an edgy expressiveness that leaps off the page. Ages 4-up.

Born to comedy royalty--TV and nightclub star Danny Thomas--she grew up among legendary funny men, carved much of her career in comedy and, to this day, surrounds herself with people who love and live to make others laugh. In this long-awaited memoir, Thomas takes us on a funny and heartwarming adventure, from her Beverly Hills childhood, to her groundbreaking creation of <i>That Girl</i> and <i>Free to Be . . . You and Me</i>, to her rise as one of America's most beloved actress-comediennes, to her marriage to talk-show king Phil Donahue.<br><br> Her youth was star-studded--Milton Berle performed magic tricks (badly) at her backyard birthday parties. George Burns, Bob Hope, Sid Caesar, Bob Newhart and other great comics passed countless hours gathered around her family's dinner table. And behind it all was the rich laughter nurtured by a close and loving family.<br><br> <i>Growing Up Laughing</i> is not just the story of an iconic entertainer, but also the story of comedy. In a voice that is curious, generous and often gleeful, Thomas not only opens the doors on the funny in her own life, but also explores the comic roots of today's most celebrated comedians, in personal interviews with: Alan Alda, Joy Behar, Stephen Colbert, Billy Crystal, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Griffin, Jay Leno, George Lopez, Elaine May, Conan O'Brien, Don Rickles, Joan Rivers, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Stewart, Ben and Jerry Stiller, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams and Steven Wright.</p><p><strong>Marlo Thomas</strong> is the author of five bestselling books, including <em>Free to Be You and Me</em> and <em>The Right Words at the Right Time</em>. She has won numerous awards including four Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe, the Grammy Award, the Peabody Award, and has been inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame for her work in television, including her starring role in the landmark series <em>That Girl</em>. She is the National Outreach Director for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She lives in New York with her husband.Some know her as the star of the 1960s TV show That Girl, or creator of Free to Be... You and Me, or perhaps major fund-raiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Thomas, author of five bestselling books, here focuses on a role she's had her entire life: daughter. Laughter was the soundtrack for Thomas's formative years in 1950s Beverly Hills. Her father, comedian Danny Thomas, regularly had funny friends--including Bob Hope, Sid Caesar, and George Burns--over to the family home. The author, actress, feminist, and philanthropist shares fond memories of enjoying and learning from these comedy luminaries, and of being a Hollywood kid long before game-changers like the Internet and cable TV. She chronicles her path from childhood to adulthood; particularly interesting tidbits include her meeting and marrying Phil Donahue, becoming friends with Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug, and, with her siblings, "producing" her father's funeral. But this book is more than a well-written memoir. Thomas also includes interviews with comedy powerhouses galore, from Tina Fey to Alan Alda, Chris Rock to Ben and Jerry Stiller. On the whole, this book offers a delightful firsthand look at how comedy has become integral to American culture--and the way it's shaped one woman's colorful life. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Into this desolate theater come aid workers, missionaries, and mercenaries of conscience whose courage and idealism sometimes coexist with treacherous moral blindness. There&#x2019;s the entrepreneurial American pilot who goes from flying food and medicine to smuggling arms, the Kenyan aid worker who can&#x2019;t help seeing the tawdry underside of his enterprise, and the evangelical Christian who comes to Sudan to redeem slaves and falls in love with a charismatic rebel commander. <br><br>As their fates intersect and our understanding of their characters deepens, it becomes apparent that <i>Acts of Faith</i> is one of those rare novels that combine high moral seriousness with irresistible narrative wizardry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty years ago, Pulitzer Prize--winning author and journalist Philip Caputo crossed the deserts of Sudan and Eritrea on foot and camelback, a journey that inspired his first novel, "Horn of Africa, and awakened a lifelong fascination with Africa. His travels have since taken him back to Sudan, as well as to Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania, and from those experiences he has fashioned "Acts of Faith, his most ambitious novel. A stunning and timely epic, it tells the stories of pilots, aid workers, missionaries, and renegades struggling to relieve the misery wrought by the civil war in Sudan. <br>The hearts of these men and women are in the right place, but as they plunge into a well of moral corruption for which they are ill-prepared, their hidden flaws conspire with circumstances to turn their strengths-bravery, compassion, daring, and empathy-into weaknesses. In pursuit of noble ends, they make ethical compromises; their altruism curdles into self-righteous zealotry and greed, entangling them in a web of conspiracies that leads, finally, to murder. A few, however, escape the moral trap and find redemption in the discovery that firm convictions can blind the best-intentioned man or woman to the difference between right and wrong. <br>Douglas Braithwaite, an American aviator who flies food and medicine to Sudan's ravaged south, is torn between his altruism and powerful personal ambitions. His partners are Fitzhugh Martin, a multiracial Kenyan who sees Sudan as a cause that can give purpose to his directionless life, and Wesley Dare, a hard-bitten bush pilot who is not as cynical as he thinks he is and sacrifices all for the woman he loves. <br>They are joined by two strong women: QuinetteHardin, an evangelical Christian from Iowa who liberates slaves captured by Arab raiders and who falls in love with a Sudanese rebel; and Diana Briggs, the daughter of a family with colonial roots in Africa, who believes that her love for her adopted continent might be enough to save it. <br>Pitted against them is Ibrahim Idris ibn Nur-el-Din, a fierce Arab warlord whose obsessive quest for an escaped concubine undermines his faith in the holy war he is waging against Sudan's southern blacks. <br>In a harsh yet alluring landscape, these and other vividly realized characters act out a drama of modern-day Africa. Grounded in the reality of today's headlines, "Acts of Faith is a captivating novel of human complexity that combines seriousness with all the seductive pleasure of a masterly thriller.Philip Caputo worked for nine years for the <i>Chicago Tribune </i>and shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for his reporting on election fraud in Chicago.

Eric, a Nordic Adonis, is graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune. Tommy is a lame black boy, cursed with health problems, yet he remains optimistic and strong.After tragedy rips their makeshift family apart, the lives of these boys diverge astonishingly: Eric, the golden youth, is given everything but trusts nothing; Tommy, motherless and impoverished, has nothing, but feels lucky every day of his life. In a riveting story of modern-day resilience and redemption, the two confront separate challenges, and when circumstances reunite them years later, they draw on their extraordinary natures to confront a common enemy and, ultimately, save their lives.</p><p>Born and raised in North Carolina, J.D.

He lives, writes, and practices law in Carthage, NC.Welcome one more of Mosley's departures from mystery fiction. FORTUNATE SON is a compassionate, lyrical, and heartbreaking story of the parallel lives of two "brothers." Lorraine Toussaint brilliantly follows the two boys: Tommy, unhealthy and plagued by the harshest of life's realities, and golden boy Eric, a privileged doctor's son. The melodrama is occasionally inflated, edging to improbable, and could be over the top in the hands of a less gifted narrator. Toussaint's thoughtful yet precise handling of the characters and relationships deeply touches the listener. She never misses the opportunity to color an unusual character, making the most of Mosley's people. The boys' lives are interwoven with tragedy and loyalty, and Toussaint is a sensitive and intuitive narrator delivering a velvety punch. R.F.W.

She had almost forgotten the remainder of the investiture ceremony. Almost. With only a slight hesitation, she walked down the steps past the bodies of her immediately deceased Uncle Joramyl and cousin Berenyt, their figures sprawled across the stone. Undercommander Areyst followed Mykella closely.<br>On the left side, at the bottom of the five low and wide stone steps leading up to the main entry of the palace entry, lay the body of Arms-Commander Nephryt who, less than a fraction of a glass before, had tried to cut her down with his saber. One of the Southern Guards had straightened his form and laid him out on his back, facing the palace. Beyond the body, a Southern Guard stood, holding the reins of the gray stallion that had been Joramyl&#x2019;s.<br>Before she mounted the stallion, Mykella turned to Areyst. &#x201c;Have the bodies prepared for a quiet family memorial. There will be no procession and no honors for any of them.&#x201d; She almost added,&nbsp;<i>Traitors do not deserve honors of any sort.</i>&nbsp;She did not. That would have made her look weak before the still-assembled Southern Guards. &#x201c;Have someone guide my sisters to the&nbsp;... Lady-Protector&#x2019;s study and provide a guard. I will see you there.&#x201d;<br>Areyst nodded. &#x201c;Yes, Lady-Protector.&#x201d;<br>She could sense a certain amusement behind his words but also approval. She couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what she had forgotten. With her Talent shields still tight about her, she swept the black cloak back over her shoulders, revealing the brilliant blue vest of the heir and the black nightsilk shirt and trousers she almost always wore. Then she mounted, wishing that she were taller and that she didn&#x2019;t have to jump to place her black boot in the stirrup. She wasn&#x2019;t about to ask for a leg up. She never had before, and now that she was the ruler of Lanachrona, she wasn&#x2019;t about to begin.<br>As she turned the stallion toward the east, before riding to the end of the palace, then north and out of sight to the rear courtyard, she used her Talent to extend her hearing, trying to pick up any words that might bode ill. Over the sound of hooves on the stone pavement that showed no sign of wear, even after thousands of years, she began to hear murmurs.<br>&#x201c;... rides like a guard...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;... never thought the daughter...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;... the one Seltyr looked to fill his britches...&#x201d;<br>Had that been Malaryk, the envoy from Southgate, or one of the local Seltyrs from Tempre? Either way, that suggested problems, not that there wouldn&#x2019;t be scores of them in the days ahead.<br>Her eyes flicked to the massive oblong structure that was the palace. Not for the first time, she wondered what function it had served in the days of the vanished Alectors who had built it, because the interior was anything but designed for a ruler, even with all the additions, such as the kitchens, made over the years.<br>After she reached the rear courtyard, she turned the stallion toward the middle rear door to the palace. Two Southern Guards looked blankly from the stallion to her, clearly not expecting the daughter of the former Lord-Protector.<br>&#x201c;A few things have changed,&#x201d; she said as she reined up. &#x201c;Lord Joramyl was executed for poisoning my father and plotting the death of my brother. So was his son. That left me as Lady-Protector, and the Seltyrs and the Southern Guards have affirmed my succession.&#x201d;<br>The younger guard swallowed hard. The older and graying guard nodded slowly. &#x201c;We have always served your family, Lady. We will continue to do so.&#x201d;<br>Mykella could sense the honesty behind the words. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; She dismounted gracefully, handed him the reins, stepped back, then turned toward the door.<br>&#x201c;... she do that?&#x201d; she heard the younger guard say as she opened the door.<br>&#x201c;She was named after Mykel the Great&nbsp;... for good reason, it appears...&#x201d;<br>As she closed the palace door behind her, she certainly hoped so, but put that thought aside as she hurried along the wide interior corridor, following it west, then south, and finally east to reach the central stone staircase&#x2014;wide as it was, the only staircase&#x2014;to the upper level of the palace. At the base of the steps were two Southern Guards, both older rankers, rather than the interior palace guards she had known. That Areyst had made that change did not surprise her, but the speed with which he had acted did. It also pleased her.<br>The one on the left inclined his head. &#x201c;Lady-Protector.&#x201d;<br>Mykella returned the nod and hurried up the stairs. Neither guard spoke again even after she passed them. Another pair of Southern Guards were stationed at the top. She nodded to both and turned to her left. In moments, she had reached her destination. For just a moment, she hesitated. Was it still Sexdi? Her father&#x2019;s memorial ceremony, just yesterday, seemed far longer than a day ago. She straightened and opened the door.<br>Chalmyr rose from behind the table-desk in the outer anteroom that guarded the entry to the study that had been her father&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Lady-Protector.&#x201d;<br>Mykella almost smiled. &#x201c;Who told you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Undercommander Areyst sent a Southern Guard to inform me. He has also placed trusted guards in places in the palace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t mention how she&#x2019;d discovered that. &#x201c;The commander is quite able and very loyal.&#x201d; She paused and looked at Chalmyr. &#x201c;How did you feel about my father&#x2019;s death and Joramyl&#x2019;s efforts to become Lord-Protector?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was distressed, Lady. I cautioned your father about Lord Joramyl once. The second time I brought up the matter, he told me never to mention the subject again if I wanted to remain as his private scrivener.&#x201d; The gray-haired functionary smiled sadly.<br>Mykella could sense the truth of the older man&#x2019;s feelings. &#x201c;Then you will serve me as loyally as you did him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If you will have me, Lady-Protector.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will&nbsp;... but only if you remain honest and tell me of your misgivings about any action I may take or contemplate.&#x201d;<br>Chalmyr bowed deeply. &#x201c;That I will, Lady.&#x201d; He straightened. &#x201c;Your sister Salyna is already awaiting you in the study.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you know where Rachylana is?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She is in her chamber. A pair of Southern Guards are posted there to keep others from intruding. The undercommander said that she was not to leave the palace without your permission.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That is correct. Matters need to settle for a time.&#x201d;<br>When Mykella stepped through the inner door, Salyna was standing to one side of the desk in the study that had always been that of the Lord-Protector of Lanachrona, a study that had become Mykella&#x2019;s as the first Lady-Protector of the land.<br>Behind the outward poise of her tall, blond, and beautiful youngest sister, Mykella could sense confusion, apprehension&nbsp;... and even some fear. Given Salyna&#x2019;s expertise and training with weapons, that fear surprised Mykella.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason for you to worry now,&#x201d; Mykella said.<br>&#x201c;You can sense that, too, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When people are close.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With what you did&nbsp;... why couldn&#x2019;t you save Father?&#x201d; Salyna&#x2019;s voice was not quite accusatory.<br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t learn what I learned fast enough.&#x201d; Mykella shook her head. &#x201c;The&nbsp;... things&nbsp;... I did&nbsp;... today&nbsp;... some of them&nbsp;... today was the first time I did them.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>At least in public.</i>&nbsp;But some of them she&#x2019;d only tried once before, and all of them&#x2014;except seeing the soarer, using the Table in the depths of the palace&#x2019;s lower levels, and beginning to sense what people felt&#x2014;she had been forced to learn in order to survive after her father&#x2019;s poisoning by Joramyl. &#x201c;Until I did them today...&#x201d; She shrugged, a gesture between resignation and helplessness. &#x201c;You know I tried to caution Father&nbsp;... and warn him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you have to kill Berenyt?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. He was weak, and Cheleyza would have manipulated him. She might even have married him. She&#x2019;s that calculating.&#x201d;<br>Before Mykella could say more, there was a rap on the study door. &#x201c;Lady-Protector, Undercommander Areyst.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have him come in.&#x201d;<br>The broad-shouldered and blond Areyst stepped into the study and immediately bowed. &#x201c;Lady-Protector.&#x201d; As he straightened, his pale green eyes met those of Mykella. She could sense a firm resolve, as well as concern for her. That boded well, since she&#x2019;d named him as both Arms-Commander of Lanachrona and her designated heir. She could also sense the thin strand of green amid the golden brown of his unseen life-thread, a thread that seemed more vital than that of Salyna&#x2019;s and far more than that of Chalmyr, whose thread was almost yellowish brown, stretching invisibly out to the east.<br>Areyst extended his hand, palm up. In it was a ring, golden with a large square-cut emerald set in the middle of the seal of Lanachrona. &#x201c;This was your father&#x2019;s. The usurper wore it.

Now,<i> </i>Joe R. Landsdale gives us a fast-moving, electrifying new novel: a murder mystery set in a steamy backwater of Depression-era East Texas. <br>It begins with an explosion: Sunset Jones kills her husband with a bullet to the brain. Never mind that he was raping her. Pete Jones was constable of the small sawmill town of Camp Rapture (&#x201c;Camp Rupture&#x201d; to the local blacks), where no woman, least of all Pete's, refuses her husband what he wants.<br><br>So most everyone is surprised and angry when, thanks to the unexpected understanding of her mother-in-law&#x2014;three-quarter owner of the mill&#x2014;Sunset is named the new constable. And they're even more surprised when she dares to take the job seriously: beginning an investigation into the murder of a woman and an unborn baby whose oil-drenched bodies are discovered buried on land belonging to the only black landowner in town. Yet no one is more surprised than Sunset herself when the murders lead her&#x2014;through a labyrinth of greed, corruption, and unspeakable malice&#x2014;not only to the shocking conclusion of the case, but to a well of inner strength she never knew she had.<br><br>Landsdale brings the thick backwoods and swamps of East Texas vividly to life, and he paints a powerfully evocative picture of a time when Jim Crow and the Klan ruled virtually unopposed, when the oil boom was rolling into and over Texas, when any woman who didn't know her place was considered a threat and a target. In Sunset, he gives us a woman who defies all expectations, wrestling a different place for herself with spirit and spit, cunning and courage. And in <i>Sunset and Sawdust</i> he gives us a wildly energetic novel&#x2014;galvanizing from first to last.</p><p>Joe R. Lansdale has written more than a dozen novels in the suspense, horror, and Western genres. He has also edited several anthologies. He has received the British Fantasy Award, the American Mystery Award, six Bram Stoker Awards, and the 2001 Edgar Award for best novel from the Mystery Writers of America. He lives in Nacogdoches, Texas, with his family.On the afternoon it rained frogs, sun perch, and minnows, Sunset discovered she could take a beating good as Three-Fingered Jack. Unlike Jack, who had taken his in the sunshine, she took hers in her own home at the tail end of a cyclone, the windows rattling, the roof lifting, the hardwood floor cold as stone.<br><br>She was on her back wearing only the top half of her dress, because the bottom half had been ripped away when Pete, during the process of beating her, had stepped on it, and the dress, rotten as politics, had torn and left her clothed only from waist to shoulders.<br><br>It went through her mind that she was down to two dresses now, and that she hated to see this one go, as it, though faded, had a flowery pattern she liked and the colors blended well with the stains.<br><br>But this was a passing thought. She was mostly thinking: How can I stop him from hitting me? She was trying to do this by holding her hands up, but he was beating them down, and her own arms and hands flying back into her face were doing near the damage his fists might have.<br><br>Finally, he hammered her to the floor, followed her down, spread her legs, went to tearing and clawing off the rest of her clothes.<br><br>When the top of her dress ripped open and he jerked loose one side of her bra, revealing her, he said, "There's that tittie." His speech was slurred and his breath seemed to bleed alcohol.<br><br>He raked at her undergarments, tore them and tossed them. When he snapped his gun belt free, he tossed it nearby, and while he was on her, tugging at his zipper, trying to put the mule in the barn, Sunset reached over and slipped his .38 revolver from its holster, and without him being aware, put it to his head, gave him one in the temple.<br><br>When she pulled the trigger the shot was loud as Gabriel blowing her up to heaven, but it was Pete who went to heaven. Or departed anyway. Sunset liked to think he got a nice chair in hell, right next to the oven.<br><br>But in that moment, the shot made her scream, once, sharp and hard as if she had taken the bullet, or as if she had just received a slap on the bottom at birth.<br><br>Pete went limp, not only in the organ he had intended to use, but all over. He said not a word. No "Ouch," "Oh shit," or "Can you believe that?" Things he liked to say under normal circumstances, moments of surprise and duress.<br><br>He just took the hot load, cut a fart near loud as the .38 shot, collapsed, and rode on out on Death's black horse.<br><br>If it wasn't bad enough she had lost her dress, underclothes, and dignity, now all the windows on the east side shook like Marley's chains, then exploded. The door leaped apart as if it had never been anything other than a loosely connected puzzle, and the wind took the roof away.<br><br>She lay there on her back, fragments of clothes fastened to her body, her old flat-heeled shoes still on her feet, a piece of window glass poking out of her shoulder, Pete lying heavy against her. She still had the gun in her hand. The shot had gone in small and hadn't come out big like she expected. It must have been a bad load, jumping around in his brain, making jelly of it. Blood ran from the wound, out of his nose and onto her.<br><br>She rolled him off and looked at him. No mistaking. He wasn't going to recover from this.<br><br>"Surprised you, didn't I?" Sunset said.<br><br>She studied Pete for a long moment, then started to scream as if a banshee were inside of her. But it wasn't screaming you would have heard if you had been in the other room. It was loud enough, but the storm was louder. The house rocked, squeaked, squealed, and whined.<br><br>Then, except for the floor, two ugly chairs, an iron cookstove, Sunset and the dead man, it was all sucked up and thrown lickety-split on down country.<br><br>Sunset, screaming, clung to the floor while the storm raved on.<br>The moment the storm passed, the sky turned clear and the sun poked out and stoked up the heat. It was as if the cool wind and rain had never been.<br><br>Sunset stood up, weak and bleeding, fragments of her clothes falling from her. She pulled the piece of glass from her shoulder. It came out smooth without causing too much damage, hardly any blood.<br><br>Naked, except for her shoes and the gun she was holding, she wandered off of what remained of her house, stumbled down the muddy clay road in front of the place, frogs, minnows, and perch hopping and flapping beneath her shoes.<br><br>She felt as lost as Cain after he killed Abel.<br><br>She saw Pete's car, turned over and smashed up, bent in half between two big oak trees as if it had been made of wet licorice. Nearby, his wooden file cabinet was burst open and there were files all over the place.<br><br>Fatefully, she came across one of her curtains, made from a flour sack and dyed blue. It had wrapped itself around a scrub tree limb and was hanging there like it was on the arm of a valet.<br><br>Sunset draped it around the lower part of her body, pulled her long red hair down over her breasts, started down the road again, mud squishing around her shoes.<br><br>Stooping to yank a mashed frog from the bottom of her shoe, she looked up to see the colored knife sharpener, Uncle Riley, coming down the road with his two mules and wagon. Uncle Riley's son, Tommy, was walking alongside him, spearing sun perch from the ground with a sharp stick, flipping them into the wagon bed.<br><br>Uncle Riley pulled on the reins when he saw her, said, "Oh, hell. Now I ain't looking, Miss White Woman. Really. And Tommy, he ain't neither. We ain't seeing a thing."<br><br>But Tommy was seeing plenty. Sunset's breasts were poking through her red hair, and Tommy had never seen breasts before, white or black, except those of his mama when suckling, but that was a long-lost memory.<br><br>Sunset, at that moment, didn't care who saw what. She was bleeding from nose and mouth and her eyes were starting to swell shut. She felt as if she had been set on fire and put out with a yard rake.<br><br>"Uncle Riley," she said, "it's me, Sunset. I been beat."<br><br>"Oh, Lord, chile, you sure have. I'm gonna get down and help you. Don't shoot at nothing now, you hear?"<br><br>Sunset staggered to one knee, tried to get up, couldn't.<br><br>Uncle Riley, who was six-four and forty-four, weighed two-twenty and had a slick bald head he covered with a droopy hat, climbed down from the wagon, took off his work shirt, kept his head turned as he walked toward her.<br><br>Uncle Riley put the shirt over Sunset's shoulders. She dropped the curtain and pulled the shirt shut and buttoned it with her free hand. All this from where she knelt on one knee. She tried again to get up, but couldn't. Uncle Riley lifted her into his arms easy as a child. She clung to the pistol as if it were a part of her hand.<br><br>He carried her to the wagon and set her on the seat, climbed up beside her. "Now I ain't touching on you, Miss Sunset."<br><br>"It's okay, Uncle Riley. You've been a real gentleman."<br><br>Tommy, who was standing beside the wagon with a fish stuck on the end of his pointed stick, had yet to close his mouth.<br><br>"Get on up here," Uncle Riley said.<br><br>Tommy climbed in the back of the wagon with the fish they had been collecting. They were scattered from one end of the wagon bed to the other, and in places they were ankle deep. Uncle Riley had seen the rain of fish as a bonus from God. Fish to eat, fish to salt and smoke for later. They had even gathered a few frogs because Tommy's mama, the midwife, Cary, liked frog legs.<br><br>Now Tommy wondered if the fish would keep because it was turning hot again and they were having to haul around this beat-up, big-tittied white woman. What in heaven's name were they going to do with her?<br><br>Tommy thought: Her hair is so long and red and wild it looks like tumbling fire. He smiled to himself. Good Lord, he had seen fish rain from the skies and he had seen a white woman's tits. It had been a special day.<br><br>"Miss Sunset, I haul you around like this, they gonna kill me," Uncle Riley said.<br><br>"Not with me with you they won't."<br><br>Sunset heard her mouth say the right things, but she felt as if it were all a dream. She scratched a place behind her ear with the barrel of the .38.<br><br>"Missy, they ain't gonna believe me. They ain't gonna believe you."<br><br>"They'll believe me."<br><br>"My cousin Jim, he just seen a white woman bending over in her yard, taking hanging clothes from a basket, and though there wasn't nothing to see cause she had her clothes on and he was up on the road, a white man seen him look at her, and for that, the word got around and them Kluxers took Jim out and castrated him, poured turpentine on thecuts."<br><br>"I tell you, it'll be okay."<br><br>"What's your husband, Mr. Pete, gonna say?"<br><br>"He ain't gonna say nothing, Uncle Riley. I blew his brains out."<br><br>"Oh, my goodness."<br><br>"Take me to my mother-in-law's."<br><br>"Sure you want to go to your mama-in-law's?" Uncle Riley said.<br><br>"My daughter's there. Ain't got nowhere else to go."<br><br>"Don't know Miss Marilyn gonna take kindly to you shooting her boy."<br><br>"I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. Oh, God, what is Karen going to think?"<br><br>"She surely loves her daddy."<br><br>"She does."<br><br>"They gonna castrate me and my boy."<br><br>"No, they're not. I'll see to it. For heaven's sake, Uncle Riley, I've known you all my life. Your wife helped deliver my baby."<br><br>"White folks forget them things when they want to. And with this Depression on, people just meaner anyhow."<br><br>The storm had come so fast and furious, it was hard to accept all the sunlight and heat, but already the fish in the back of the wagon were beginning to sme...</p><h2>Columbo: The Game Show Killer</h2><p>For over twenty-five years, Columbo has been the most popular , and persistent, detective on television, drawing millions of viewers a week. William Harrington's compelling new novel pits the famous TV detectives against one of the most brilliant and flamboyant lawyers in the country. It may seem like the perfect murder, but if there's the tiniest flaw, the famous Lieutenant Columbo will find it.<br></p><p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tuesday, April 4--7:58 p.m.<br>&nbsp;<br>The stools in the dimly lit bar of the Pacific Club were upholstered in tan leather. They had arms and thickly padded seats. When Grant Kellogg lifted himself onto one of them just before eight o'clock he was emotionally drained and physically exhausted. He was acutely conscious of his fatigue. He told himself he could not remember a time when he had been so tired.<br>"Congratulations, Mr. Kellogg."<br>Emily, the petite topless barmaid, put in front of him a Beefeater martini on the rocks with a twist. She didn't have to be told that was what he wanted.<br>The sight of the girl was enough to lift a man's spirits. She was delicately, youthfully beautiful, with dark-brown hair neatly brushed back, and with an innocent, open face dominated by wide blue eyes. It was a strict rule of the club that a girl who worked there would be fired if she accepted any sort of proposition from a member--and that he would lose his membership. It had happened. It was the only reason he did not offer her a thousand dollars. Well...five hundred.<br>"There's been nothing but you on television all evening," she said.<br>He nodded. "Price and I," he sighed.<br>"I knew he wasn't guilty. I just knew he wasn't. And when he got <i>you</i> to defend him--Well, the poor DA never had a chance, did he?"<br>"I wouldn't say that, Emily. I was never sure we'd get Price off. When that jury came back--" He shook his head. "You can't imagine the tension."<br>"I can imagine. I was watching. And, hey, when I said to some friends of mine that I'd probably be serving drinks to Grant Kellogg tonight--Hey! Anyway, congratulations, Mr. Kellogg."<br>"Thank you. You're very kind--besides being a lovely girl."<br>It was said that Grant Kellogg's appearance, presence, and manner were major elements of his success as a trial lawyer. He was a big man with broad shoulders. His hair had turned white before he was thirty-five, but it had never thinned. His complexion was ruddy--the result maybe of his consumption of thousands of bottles of Beefeater gin. His eyes, peering out from narrow slits, were pale blue and focused in a hypnotic stare. He wore perfectly tailored suits with white shirts and striped ties. He favored French cuffs and heavy gold cuff links.<br>Lawyers who thought his success was dependent on his rhetorical flamboyance in the courtroom were the lawyers he most often overpowered. The truth was that Grant Kellogg was a hardworking lawyer who came into the courtroom thoroughly <i>prepared</i> to try his cases. He came prepared with meticulously researched law and with total mastery of the facts. Besides having an almost-photographic memory, he came to court with a laptop computer, which one of his associates used to check law and facts as the trial progressed.<br>Jim Price was a film producer, a handsome man, a notorious womanizer, a gossip-column-and-tabloid celebrity, and a Hollywood iconoclast. More than a few in the community had been amused and pleased when he was charged with the murder of his wife. The whole nation had been obsessively fascinated with every detail of his case. Acquitted at four this afternoon, he would be in bed with Bonnie by now, laboring to make up for eleven months in jail. He had signed a contract to produce a book about his experience. It would be a tissue of lies. It had better be. Whatever he wrote--or had written for him--he'd make a fortune from it.<br>Emily had served a man and woman down the bar, and now she returned. "If I ever get accused of anything...," she said with a wide smile.<br>"Don't ever get accused of anything, Emily. But if you do, I'll defend you."<br>"I couldn't afford you, Mr. Kellogg."<br>"Gratis."<br>"Would you, really?"<br>"Of course."<br>"Another martini?"<br>He nodded. He hadn't finished the first one, but he knew he'd want another. And maybe a third. Then he'd go down-stairs for dinner.<br>"Hello, Grant!"<br>Now he knew he'd want a third drink. If there was anyone he didn't need to see, it was Chalmers Willoughby.<br>"Congratulations, Grant. Another brilliant performance."<br>"Thank you. Pull up a stool." There was no point in not welcoming Chalmers; he was going to sit down anyway. "I think I lost ten pounds trying that case. Do my clothes look funny?"<br>"<i>Your</i> clothes <i>never</i> look funny. You always have about you that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>. Style, I guess it's called."<br>"I try."<br>"Black Label, Mr. Willoughby?"<br>Willoughby nodded at Emily. "On the rocks. You're looking beautiful, as usual."<br>"Thank you."<br>No matter if he tried or didn't, and no matter how hard he tried, Chalmers Willoughby could not appeal to a girl like Emily or put her at ease. In her case, he stared too hard. With other women, he spoke with too much intense sincerity and said clumsy things. He was dull. He had no �lan. Fifty years old, with thinning black hair but big bushy eyebrows, he was not an unattractive man, but his want of grace put him in distinct contrast to Grant Kellogg.<br>Emily put his drink in front of Willoughby, then moved down the bar to allow the two men to talk privately. Willoughby watched her. His appraising eyes chilled her.<br>"I suppose she wants to get into show business," he said to Grant.<br>"Don't they all? I'd say she's <i>already</i> in show business."<br>"Yes. She surely is. Well...congratulations again."<br>Willoughby stared at his drink for a moment, then stared at Emily again, and finally looked at Grant. "I don't suppose this is the best time or place to mention it, but sometime we're going to have to talk about your notes."<br>"I have no doubt," Grant said dryly.<br>"I think you'll agree that the bank has not been demanding."<br>"No. The bank has been Very fair."<br>"You must have gotten a tremendous fee from Price."<br>"Do you want to know? You're my banker; you're entitled to know. He has paid me a million dollars."<br>"My god, then--"<br>Grant nodded. "'My god' is right. I'd be glad to have you go through my books and see where that money went. To start with, I paid Duke $4,000 a day to sit with me as co-counsel at trial--also to spend his evenings with me, going over the testimony and all the rulings, which is not an unreasonable amount for a lawyer who can make $400 an hour with no trouble. And he was worth it. We were in trial for fifty-eight days, which cost me $232,000. Besides that, he billed me for eight days of trial preparation--another $32,000. Lila, my young associate, gets $85,000 a year, and her time was wholly devoted to the case for eight months. There's $56,000.1 had to hire a law student to do research and write memoranda of law for me. She cost me $12,000.I had the court reporter delivering tapes to us at the end of every day of trial, which tapes we put in computer memory so we could review testimony. For fifty-eight days, that process cost me something like $40,000. LEXIS and NEXIS computer research is invaluable, but not cheap. I paid artists to make charts, messengers to run documents back and forth, and so on. I had more than $382,000 in expenses."<br>"Grant--"<br>"I had to guarantee the fees and travel expenses of the expert witnesses, eleven of them. Price is supposed to pay those fees and expenses, but he hasn't been able to so far, so I'm out more than $150,000 that I may or may not get from him. Besides that, he is supposed to pay for the jury-research outfit we used. That's $30,000 more that I won't get until he gets his book out."<br>"Grant--"<br>"To keep my office, just to have my office: building space, secretaries, phones, equipment, insurance, and all the rest--Say, $28,000 a month, minimum. I had the Price case for eleven months, and it averages out that eight months were exclusively devoted to his defense. That makes $224,000 office costs."<br>"Grant--"<br>"Attributable to the Price defense: about $786,000. The million doesn't look like so much now, does it?"<br>"Grant--"<br>"I gave eight months of my professional time to the case. So I've got, say, a little more than $214,000 left for eight months of my professional life. Out of which I've got to pay income taxes. So I'm a fuckin' millionaire?"<br>Emily detected a break in the conversation and approached to ask if either man wanted another drink. Both agreed to another round.<br>Willoughby shook his head. "What you're telling me is that Price paid you a million dollars to defend him, which is going to leave you not very well fixed, but he's going to sell his story for so much that <i>he'll</i> wind up <i>very</i> well fixed."<br>Grant tossed back the last of his second martini. "You've got it. He killed his wife and--"<br>"<i>Grant</i>!"<br>"He did. We may as well say it. He's been acquitted and can't be tried again. He killed his wife, and he's going to make more money from the story than he could have made producing films during the months he was in jail. I mean, god almighty, nothing sells better than an accused and acquitted celebrity. Besides the book he's gonna do, he'll be appearing on television--not just tabloid TV, but on supposedly respectable news shows--and...Christ! I sometimes think I should kill somebody myself. There's no better way to make really big money. Of course, I'm not a celebrity in the way Price is. Damn it!"<br>"Why don't <i>you</i> write a book on the Price trial?"<br>"I'd like to, but Price and his publisher and ghostwriter went to work on it five months ago. You know what? I was approached. But, damn it, Chalmers, you can't prepare and try a case and write a book about it at the same time! Do you have any idea how many witnesses and potential witnesses I had to interview? How many motions I had to prepare and argue? How many preliminary hearings I had to attend? Christ, man! I put in twelve- and fourteen-hour days on the Price defense, <i>before</i> we went to trial--sixteen-hour days when we <i>were</i> in trial. Even if I'd had a ghost, I didn't have time to put my thoughts together and give the guy something to work on."<br>"I think I understand."<br>"I think you do. Most people think handling big criminal cases is glamorous and lucrative." Grant paused and sighed noisily. "Try it, my friend." He shook his head. "It's a trap. I wish I could get out of it and work on accident cases, property cases, and so on. I can't. Before the week is over, somebody with more money than good sense will commit some awful crime and offer me what looks like big money to defend."<br>Chalmers Willoughby sipped Scotch and nodded sympathetically. "I will welcome the opportunity to do anything I can to help you, Grant. But...We <i>must</i> sometime begin working out a payment plan to retire your notes."<br>"I am well aware of that."<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1996 by MCA Publishing Rights, a Division of MCA, Inc.Everyman's detective is just as dogged as ever in his pursuit of justice. Grant Kellogg, the most successful defense attorney in L.A., comes to the annoying realization that a million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to. In fact, after his last acquittal, it's the defendant who inks a book contract and makes out like a bandit. So Kellogg decides to build his own trial of the century?but this time, he'll have a piece of the action. Six years earlier, game-show hostess Erika Bjorling's daughter, Tammy, was kidnapped and murdered and the culprit was never found. The glamorous Bjorling is now hurting for money. Sharklike, Kellogg tells her the killer was Tammy's father, beloved western star Tim Wylie, whose indiscretions have been one of Hollywood's best-kept secrets. Next, Kellogg tells her his plan: she kills Wylie, gets caught, goes to trial, is defended by Kellogg and acquitted, after which the two of them clean up on a book deal and some pay-per-view. As it turns out, Columbo is the steepest slope of all in this lightning-fast read. Still clad in his rumpled raincoat, still endearing and untroubled, he takes on greed and cynicism in his droopy, inimitable way. The prose is thin?Harrington doesn't waste time on complex characterizations?and there's barely a whiff of suspense, but readers will come away as satisfied as the tourists who gather to watch Old Faithful spout. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fireside Book of Chess</h2><p>The Fireside Book of Chess [Jun 01, 1966] Irving Chernev and Fred Reinfeld ...</p><p>Irving Chernev was born on January 29, 1900 in Pryluky in the Ukraine. He emigrated to the United States in 1920. He wrote some of the most successful and widely read chess books ever written. Contrary to popular belief and to the publicity blurbs on the chess books he wrote, Chernev was not an especially strong player. However, he was an entertaining writer. His books are not read for the deep analysis but rather for the curious facts and amusing stories which have become part of chess lore that every chess player in the world now knows, even those who have not read his books. He wrote that he &#34;probably read more about chess, and played more games than any man in history.&#34; Chernev&#39;s love for the game is obvious to any reader of his books. He wrote 20 chess books, among them: Chessboard Magic!; The Bright Side of Chess; The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played; 1000 Best Short Games of Chess; Practical Chess Endings; Combinations: The Heart of Chess; and Capablanca&#39;s Best Chess Endings. In 1945, he and Kenneth Harkness wrote An Invitation to Chess. Perhaps his most famous book is Logical Chess: Move by Move. He died in San Francisco, California on September 29, 1981. Fred Reinfeld was born on January 27, 1910. Although Fred Reinfeld is now remembered as a writer about chess and other subjects, he was also a strong player. In the 1950 USCF Rating List he was rated number 6 in the United States with a rating of 2593. He defeated Reshevsky twice and Fine once in tournament games and drew World Champion Alekhine in the grandmaster tournament in Pasadena 1932, the strongest tournament ever played in the Western United States. Reinfeld wrote more than one hundred chess books. In his day, almost all young chess players started off on his books. Nowadays, his books are mostly out of print because they were written in descriptive notation, as this one was. He died on May 29, 1964.</p><h2>Wind machines (The MITRE energy resources and environment series)</h2><p>&#34;The wind.

As a journalist, Gellhorn covered every military conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Vietnam and Nicaragua. She also bewitched Eleanor Roosevelt's secret love and enraptured Ernest Hemingway with her courage as they dodged shell fire together.<p> Hemingway is, of course, the unnamed "other" in the title of this tart memoir, first published in 1979, in which Gellhorn describes her globe-spanning adventures, both accompanied and alone. With razor-sharp humor and exceptional insight into place and character, she tells of a tense week spent among dissidents in Moscow; long days whiled away in a disused water tank with hippies clustered at Eilat on the Red Sea; and her journeys by sampan and horse to the interior of China during the Sino-Japanese War.</p><p> Now including a foreward by Bill Buford and photographs of Gellhorn with Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Gary Cooper, and others, this new edition rediscovers the voice of an extraordinary woman and brings back into print an irresistibly entertaining classic. </p></p><p>Martha Gellhorn published five novels and seven prize-winning collections of her explosive journalism.

To this end he has aimed to express these fundamental doctrines in the simplest and clearest manner possible. This book contains the cream and meat of Larkin&#39;s sermons, condensed and arranged in a form that will grip the interest of the reader, because of the manner of their presentation. The charts are clear and simple and add much to the value of the book, and will be suggestive to preachers and bible teachers presenting these fundamental doctrines.</p><p>The Reverend Clarence Larkin was one of the most widely influential Christian fundamentalists of the early twentieth century, and his writings remain key to appreciating the conservative religious thought that today enjoys widespread popularity. <p> This 1920 work outlines the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as revealed by the Bible, from "The Mystery of Godliness" to "Election and Free-will."

But this time, Lily and her friends are fed up with his teasing and decide to give Shad a taste of his own medicine. When Lily and her friends play the ultimate prank on Shad, guess who&#39;s left to take the fall? Lily. Lily and Shad get assigned a project that they must complete TOGETHER after school. Will this finally bring an end to the infamous feud between Lily and Shad? Or is it the beginning of something much worse? See what happens when Lily makes an unpleasant discovery and has to decide what&#39;s important---becoming someone she can like or someone God can like.</p><p>Nancy Rue has written over 100 books for girls, is the editor of the Faithgirlz Bible, and is a popular speaker and radio guest with her expertise in tween and teen issues. She and husband, Jim, have raised a daughter of their own and now live in Tennessee.Hey, Robbins,&#39; Leo Cooks hissed in Lily&#39;s ear. Don&#39;t answer, Lily Robbins told herself sternly. It&#39;s a trick. She concentrated on not touching his sweaty hand---even though Ms. Gooch had said &#39;join hands with your partner.&#39; &#39;Ms. Gooch is lookin&#39; at ya,&#39; Leo whispered. His breath was hot, and it made Lily want to slap her hand over her ear, but she ignored him. &#39;She&#39;s givin&#39; you the eyebrow,&#39; Leo persisted. That was not a good thing. The teacher&#39;s eyebrow was usually the last warning sign before a name went on the board or something. Don&#39;t fall into this absurd little creep&#39;s trap, Lily thought. Leo wasn&#39;t actually little. He was even bigger than his buddy Shad Shifferdecker, who was at this very moment managing to step all over the feet of his partner---Lily&#39;s best friend, Reni Johnson. Even as Lily watched, he caught Reni on the side of her Nike with his left Timberland. She jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow. Don&#39;t let him know he&#39;s getting to you, Reni, Lily thought. Right. Just then Leo jabbed her in the side and hissed, &#39;You better take my hand. Ms. Gooch&#39;s got both eyebrows goin&#39;!&#39; Both eyebrows and the don&#39;t-start-with-me tone. &#39;Join hands, people,&#39; she called out over the blaring of Italian music. Taking a breath full of dread, Lily slid her hand into Leo&#39;s. He squeezed it like he was wringing out a dishrag, and suddenly, Lily felt a jolt go up her arm. Before she could stop herself, she&#39;d let out a yell. The music came to an abrupt halt, and Ms. Gooch planted her hands on her hips. Both black eyebrows were in full gear. &#39;All right, who&#39;s yelling?&#39; she said. &#39;It was Lily,&#39; Marcie McCleary said. Lily tucked a curl of red hair behind her ear and otherwise tried to look innocent. &#39;All right, you two,&#39; Ms. Gooch said. &#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; Iwasn&#39;t doing anything! Lily wanted to protest. It was him! Still, Lily pressed her full lips together and kept quiet. She&#39;d die before she&#39;d be a tattletale like Marcie McCleary. &#39;So what&#39;s the story?&#39; Ms. Gooch said. &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; Leo said. &#39;You told us to join hands, so I grabbed hers and she started yelling.&#39; &#39;Is there a problem, Lily?&#39; &#39;Lily is a problem,&#39; Shad Shifferdecker said. Daniel Tibbetts snorted. Ms. Gooch waved both of them off with an impatient hand. She didn&#39;t lose patience often, and the class got that uncomfortable kind of quiet like when they were waiting to see if somebody was going to get sent to the office. &#39;Lily,&#39; she said again, &#39;is there a problem?&#39; Lily rubbed her fingers into her palm where moments ago Leo had set off some kind of buzzer-shock thing. But she shook her head no. &#39;No,&#39; she said. &#39;Everything&#39;s fine.&#39; &#39;Do you always yell when everything&#39;s fine?&#39; Ashley asked. Ashley&#39;s best friend, Chelsea Green, let out her shriek of a laugh, and Marcie joined in because she always joined in when Ashley and Chelsea laughed, whether she knew what they were laughing at or not. Lily noticed with relief that her friends continued to glare at Leo and Shad. &#39;We&#39;re about finished here anyway,&#39; Ms. Gooch said. &#39;Let&#39;s go back to the room.&#39; Leo left Lily&#39;s side with a flailing of long arms and legs. Lily did her most poised walk up to the tape recorder where Ms. Gooch was busily pushing buttons. &#39;Ms. Gooch?&#39; Lily said. &#39;I&#39;m really sorry.&#39; Ms. Gooch frowned down at the tape deck. &#39;I&#39;m sure you were provoked. You want to tell me what was going on?&#39; &#39;It wasn&#39;t that big of a deal. I just overreacted.&#39; Lily could see Ms. Gooch was trying to smother a smile. &#39;&#39;Overreacted&#39;?&#39; she said. &#39;Yes,&#39; Lily replied. It was a term her mother used all the time when she was talking about the way Lily responded to her two brothers. &#39;So what were you &#39;overreacting&#39; to?&#39; Ms. Gooch said. &#39;I don&#39;t want to say. Could I change partners?&#39; &#39;Nope. Sorry,&#39; Ms. Gooch said. &#39;If I let you switch, I&#39;ll have everybody and her dog up here whining. I ought to just let you girls all dance with each other, but then I&#39;d have to let the boys dance with each other, and we&#39;d have even worse chaos.&#39; She shook her head at Lily again. &#39;Just tough it out, Lily,&#39; she said. &#39;If anybody can do it, you can.&#39; At any other time, a compliment like that would have had Lily walking out of the multipurpose room with her spirit soaring. But right now, she didn&#39;t care how tough she was. She was sick of dealing with Leo and Daniel and, worst of all, Shad. He was the one who had put Leo up to it, that was plain. &#39;Whoa, she really must have yelled at you,&#39; Zooey said as Lily pushed her way through the double doors and out into the courtyard where the Girlz were gathered. They were all there---the whole Girlz Only Club---Reni and Zooey and Kresha and Suzy. It made Lily feel better already to have them around her---Reni&#39;s black face set to get revenge and Zooey&#39;s round one flushed with concern, Suzy&#39;s tiny eyebrows all puckered up in worry, and Kresha&#39;s pale eyes peeking hopefully through her straggly bangs. &#39;Men,&#39; Zooey said in disgust. &#39;They&#39;re the worst,&#39; Reni said. &#39;I thought I had it bad having to dance with Shad, but you got it even worse. The whole time I was waiting for him to do something to me, and all the time it was Leo he had doing the dirty work. I shoulda known.&#39; &#39;What do we do?&#39; Zooey said. &#39;I have to dance with Daniel, which means I&#39;m probably next, which means---&#39; Zooey&#39;s voice was starting to wind up into a whine. &#39;Don&#39; vorry about it,&#39; Kresha said. Her eyes were crinkling behind her bangs, and she flung a skinny arm around Lily&#39;s neck. Kresha was the most touchy-feely of all of them. The Girlz had decided it must be because she was Croatian. They probably did a lot of hugging in Croatia or something. &#39;Lee-lee will think of something,&#39; she said now. &#39;She alvez does.&#39; &#39;Well, you better think of something fast,&#39; Reni said, &#39;before I have to smack somebody.&#39; &#39;Would you really hit one of them?&#39; Zooey said, eyes round. &#39;No, I would not,&#39; Reni said. &#39;But I&#39;d sure like to.&#39; &#39;Okay, so I&#39;ll think of something,&#39; Lily said. &#39;Tomorrow.&#39; &#39;Not today?&#39; Kresha said. &#39;No---remember today we got to clean the clubhouse,&#39; Reni said. &#39;Or my mama says she&#39;s gonna close us down.&#39; &#39;It is getting kind of disgusting in there,&#39; Lily said. They met every day after school in the playhouse-turned-clubhouse in Reni&#39;s backyard. Reni&#39;s mother decreed no more meetings until it was cleaned. Besides, Lily thought, it&#39;ll give me some time to think of something. It was always up to her to come up with solutions to their problems. She didn&#39;t mind that---in fact, she kind of liked it. It was time she started looking for a new direction for her life anyway, she decided. It was the never-ending quest ... trying to figure out who she was. The trouble was, this thing with the boys had been going on all year, and although she&#39;d learned a lot since last fall, she still hadn&#39;t figured out how to keep Shad, Leo, and Daniel from constantly messing things up for the Girlz. Looking better, feeling better---those were cool things. But so far, they hadn&#39;t cracked the boy problem. &#39;Hey, Snobbins,&#39; Shad Shifferdecker hissed as she passed him on the way to the street. She didn&#39;t answer. &#39;All right, but don&#39;t blame me if you walk all the way home with that big piece of toilet paper stuck to your shoe.&#39; Lily looked down in spite of herself. There was nothing stuck to her shoe. &#39;Ha-ha---made ya look!&#39; Shad said. The Girlz were right. She had to think of something before the boys got control of them completely.</p><h2>Quaker Silence (Elizabeth Elliot Mystery)</h2><p>An elderly Quaker widow living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Elizabeth Elliot investigates the brutal slaying of a wealthy Quaker to save an innocent man from being unjustly convicted of the crime.</p><p>Reflection rather than heart-pounding action marks this subdued and sober first mystery by the pseudonymous Allen. When a devout member of the Society of Friends in Cambridge, Mass., is murdered, other members of the community confront volatile, timely issues, including homelessness and sexual preference. As the Clerk of the Friends Meeting, 66-year-old widow Elizabeth Elliot moderates Quaker gatherings and informally counsels her peers. It is she who encourages them to accept a homeless man at the weekly services of silent prayer, and she who calmly presides over a vigorous debate about whether to recognize homosexual marriage as valid. The murder victim was a wealthy Quaker businessman who was opposed to gay unions; his announcement that he planned to revise his will , made at a Sunday meeting shortly before his death, suggests that the killer is a Quaker. Saddened by events and determined to see justice served, Elizabeth methodically investigates, a process involving discussing the crime over tea with friends and suspects. This mellow, well-orchestrated debut may seem tame to readers accustomed to violence and displays of intense emotion. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Debut "detective" Elizabeth Elliott, 66-year-old Clerk of Meeting for a Boston church, embodies a number of Quaker qualities that aid her in discovering the killer of a wealthy but troubled Friend. Reluctantly pressured into clearing the name of a homeless man accused of the crime, Elliott persists in questioning suspects until she solves the case. The combination of contemplative heroine and low-level action results in a slow-moving, bland plot of little interest.<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lafcadio Hearn&#39;s &#34;The Faceless Ghost&#34; and Other Macabre Tales from Japan: A Graphic Novel</h2><p><b>Eerie traditional Japanese ghost stories retold in a graphic novel format.</b><br><br><b>Nominated for the prestigious&nbsp;EISNER BOOK AWARD, 2016</b><b>2016&nbsp;YALSA 'Great Graphic Novels for Teens' Recommendation</b><b></b><b>Bronze Prize in the 2016 Independent Publishers Book Awards.</b><b></b>Over one hundred years ago, the writer Lafcadio Hearn gathered and translated into English a selection of traditional Japanese ghost/mystery stories. They were published as <i>Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. </i>In this new graphic novel, acclaimed manga creator Sean Michael Wilson retells six of these stories. All of them are very well known in Japan, where ghosts and demons are often called <i>yokai,</i> meaning "the mysterious and weird." Today these stories find expression mostly in movies and manga, but they remain rooted in the traditional ghost stories of the Edo era known as <i>kaidan,</i> which means "recited narrative of strange, mysterious, rare, or bewitching apparitions." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The book includes an afterword by the author, Sean Michael Wilson, who puts the stories into historical and personal context.<br><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b> <b></b></p><p>SEAN MICHAEL WILSON is a comic book writer from Scotland, living in Japan.

With Sean Michael Wilson, she has created four graphic novels: <i>Buskers</i>, <i>Yakuza Moon</i>, <i>The Demon's Sermon on the Martial Arts, </i>and <i>Musashi.</i>Gr 8 Up-A well-done graphic novel featuring new interpretations of traditional Japanese tales of terror. With six stories of vengeful spirits, mischievous men, and wayward journeys, this graphic novel offers a beautifully drawn interpretation of Lafcadio Hearn's famous renditions of Japanese tales of suspense. Fans can find these selections in various collections, but this work cleverly compiles an interesting group of stories that offer an introduction to Japanese horror folklore. Wilson closely mirrors traditional methods of translation as he reimagines each piece for a graphic modern adventure. While this method creates a mood akin to that felt when reading a more traditional story format, it may prevent immersion from some readers not used to this type of "subtle scare" in their horror. On the other hand, illustrator Morikawa's depictions perfectly capture the essence of each adventure with captivating character models and adept landscapes. With audiences with a high interest in Japanese horror, this graphic novel may circulate well. Tighter collections may want to pick graphic titles from Edogawa Ranpo or Junji Ito.

Lila Hill taught piano, then ultimately took a job off the farm to augment the family income during a period of rising costs. From Montana's cattle pastures to New Mexico's sagebrush mesas, women on today's ranches and farms have played a crucial role in a way of life that is slowly disappearing from the western landscape. <br><br>Recalling her own family-farm ties, Sandra Schackel set out to learn how these women's lives have changed over the second half of the twentieth century. In <i>Working the Land</i>, she collects oral histories from more than forty women&#x2014;in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas&#x2014;recalling their experiences as ranchers and farmers in a modernizing West. <br><br>Through this diverse group of women-white and Hispanic, rich and poor, ranging in age from 24 to 83&#x2014;we gain a new perspective on their ties to the land. Although western ranch and farm women have often been portrayed as secondary figures who devoted themselves to housekeeping in support of their husbands' labors, Schackel's interviews reveal that these women have had a much more active role in defining what we know as the modern American West. <br><br>As Schackel listened to their stories, she found several currents running through their recollections, such as the satisfaction found in living the rural lifestyle and the flexibility of gender roles. She also learned how resourceful women developed new ways to make their farms work&#x2014;by including tourism, summer camps, and bed-and-breakfast operations&#x2014;and how many have become activists for land-based issues. And while some like Lila made the difficult decision to work off the farm, such sacrifices have enabled families to hold onto their beloved land. <br><br>Rich with memory and insight into what makes America's family farms and ranches tick, <i>Working the Land</i> provides a deeper understanding of the West's development over the last fifty years along with new perspectives on shifting attitudes toward women in the workforce. It is both a long-overdue documentation of the lives of hard-working farm women and a celebration of their contributions to a truly American way of life.</p><p>"An impressive book that tells a multifaceted story of economic survival in troubled times, of strong women wrangling animals and running mowers, and also doing all of the other things necessary to run a farm or ranch."--Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, author of <i>Childhood on the Farm: Work, Play, and Coming of Age in the Midwest</i><p> "Skillfully weaves together personal stories and recent scholarship to show how contemporary farm and ranch women of the Mountain West find value and stability in their lives."--Susan H.

Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896 to an upper-middle-class Irish-American family. On his father&#x2019;s side, he was a distant relation to Francis Scott Key, who penned the &#x201c;The Star Spangled Banner&#x201d;; hence his full name, Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. On the verge of flunking out of Princeton, he joined the army as America entered the First World War. After the war, he married Zelda, and they instantly became a celebrity couple in New York&#x2019;s caf� society and, for the press, the embodiment of everything the new era promised or threatened. Besides being an author of novels and short stories, Fitzgerald also was a screenwriter for MGM.<p><b>From the Introduction by David Greenstein</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p><p>No writer&#x2019;s debut in the world of American letters made a bigger splash than <b>F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s</b>. From his first appearance as a novelist with <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, published in 1920, he was acclaimed as the writer who defined and personified a new era. Fitzgerald coined the phrase &#x201c;the Jazz Age,&#x201d; and along with his wife, Zelda, set the standard for its lifestyle. Known today primarily for his novels&#x2014;<i>The Great Gatsby </i>above all&#x2014;he was famous in the 1920s and 1930s as a writer of short stories.&nbsp; The nineteen stories in this volume (two of which are presented as one-act plays) first appeared in weekly or monthly magazines between January 1920 and June 1922, and shortly thereafter, in two hardcover collections, <i>Flappers and Philosophers </i>and <i>Tales of the Jazz Ag</i>e<i>.</i>&nbsp; The great writer's gifts&#x2014;what Matthew Bruccoli, a leading Fitzgerald scholar, has called "the Fitzgerald touch"&#x2014;were sharp wit, gorgeous description, and precise observation. With these, he portrayed the emotional depth of a society devoted to excess and racing heedlessly towards catastrophe that was only a few years ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stories in this volume, like much of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s work, come directly from the circumstances of his life, but they are not autobiographical. Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896 to an upper-middle-class Irish-American family. On his father&#x2019;s side, he was a distant relation to Francis Scott Key, who penned the &#x201c;The Star Spangled Banner&#x201d;; hence his full name, Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. His Midwestern background and Roman Catholicism made him (at least in his own eyes) a permanent outsider in the world of the urbane East. Thanks to his mother&#x2019;s inheritance, he attended several prep schools and from thirteen years old on wrote articles and stories for his school papers. In 1913, Fitzgerald entered Princeton where he devoted more time to writing and performing in plays and musicals than to his studies. On the verge of flunking out, he quit Princeton in 1917 and joined the army as America entered the First World War.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The war ended before Fitzgerald could go overseas, but during his military service he completed a first draft of a novel that eventually became <i>This Side of Paradise</i>. Also, while stationed at Camp Sheridan in Alabama, he met the beautiful and talented Zelda Sayre, the belle of Montgomery, Alabama. Their courtship was rocky. Upon leaving the army, Scott worked for an advertising agency in New York and began writing stories for publication with virtually no success. His prospects appeared so dim that Zelda broke off their engagement. Retreating to his parents&#x2019; home in St. Paul, Fitzgerald revised the novel. This time it was accepted by Scribner&#x2019;s, whose editor Maxwell Perkins became Fitzgerald&#x2019;s lifelong friend as well as his literary and financial supporter. <i>This Side of Paradise</i> was published in March 1920. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The years following the end of World War I in 1918 saw a tremendous change in American lifestyles and morals, and <i>This Side of Paradise</i> perfectly captured the new mood of the young.<i> </i>As Fitzgerald put it in the novel<i>, </i>&#x201c;Here was a new generation . . .&nbsp; grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.&#x201d; These were the Americans that Gertrude Stein dubbed &#x201c;the Lost Generation.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acceptance of his novel<i> </i>prompted Zelda to reconsider her engagement to Fitzgerald and they were married a week after its publication. Scott and Zelda instantly became a celebrity couple in New York&#x2019;s caf� society and, for the press, the embodiment of everything the new era promised or threatened. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s income (as recorded in his meticulously kept notebooks) was only $879 in 1919, but between 1920 and 1922, he averaged around $20,000 to $25,000 a year. In terms of current dollars, this would be an increase from about $9,000 per year to over $250,000. The Fitzgeralds lived extravagantly, bought a Rolls Royce, and took extended trips to Europe. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the end of the First World War, America was at the dawn of a decade of unprecedented prosperity and change. In 1920, women won the right to vote. Hemlines rose from the ankle to the knee. Prohibition ended the legal sale and drinking of alcohol throughout the country, but increased its widespread consumption. Speakeasies and private cocktail parties became the center of social life for men and women, a striking break from previously all-male bars. Automobile ownership grew rapidly, as did cigarette smoking (especially by women for whom it had previously been taboo). The saxophone became the favored instrument of the younger generation while on the dance floor the provocative Charleston and Shimmy replaced the stately prewar waltz.&nbsp; America wanted nothing to interfere with its prosperity: the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia ignited a &#x201c;red scare&#x201d; in the United States that led to riots and even lynching in 1919 and for some years thereafter. Real strife&#x2014;like a riot at a Socialist newspaper on May 1, 1919&#x2014;became the crux of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s story, &#x201c;May Day.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fitzgerald&#x2019;s income from his novels (<i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>was published in 1922 and <i>The Great Gatsby</i> in 1925) could not support him, Zelda, and their daughter, Frances Scott Fitzgerald (&#x201c;Scottie&#x201d;), born in 1921. As a result, he wrote stories for magazines including popular &#x201c;slicks&#x201d; such as the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>Collier&#x2019;s</i>, as well as the more intellectual <i>The Smart Set</i>. In addition to <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, Fitzgerald wrote four other novels: <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> (serialized in 1921 and published in hardcover in 1922), <i>The Great Gatsby </i>(1925),<i> Tender is the Night</i> (1934), and <i>The Last Tycoon</i> (left unfinished at his death in 1940 and published the following year). <i>&nbsp;</i>He also wrote about one hundred sixty stories. Although Fitzgerald considered his novels to be his major works of art, the stories paid the bills. Despite his own tendency to devalue them, some of his best writing appears in his short stories. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>America in the early 1920s had three mass-entertainment media: radio, silent movies, and magazines. A number of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s magazine stories found their way onto to the movie screens, adding to his income. From both a business and personal standpoint, Fitzgerald was lucky to find a literary agent, Harold Ober, who would manage his magazine work (and serve as his unofficial banker) until near the end of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s life. A January 1920 letter from Fitzgerald to Ober, referring to &#x201c;The Camel&#x2019;s Back,&#x201d; sets the importuning tone for hundreds that would follow:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Mr. Ober:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Here&#x2019;s a &#x201c;<i>Post</i> Story&#x201d; I feel pretty sure. If you sell &#x201c;Bernice&#x201d; please <i>wire</i> me the</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money as soon as you can because I am very broke. Am sending another story </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on in two days. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I received the proofs and forwarded them on to the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i> Thanks for your letter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Ever</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F. Scott Fitzgerald</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Five of the stories included in this volume first appeared in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, the largest mass circulation &#x201c;slick&#x201d; with a readership of 2.75 million in the 1920s. For his first <i>Post</i> story, &#x201c;Head and Shoulders,&#x201d; published in 1920, Fitzgerald received $400. Magazine editors soon competed for his work. The <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>&#x2019;s main rival, <i>Collier&#x2019;s</i>, and <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i> both sought Fitzgerald stories, with <i>Metropolitan</i> upping the fee to $900 per story&#x2014;nearly double what the <i>Post</i> was paying him at that time. His literary agent, Harold Ober, arranged for the <i>Post</i> to have first refusal on all Fitzgerald stories and his fee eventually reached $4,000 per story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seven of these stories, too sophisticated for the mass-circulation magazines, appeared in <i>The Smart Set</i>, a leading literary magazine edited by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan. With a circulation of about<i> </i>22,000, <i>The Smart Set</i> did not pay nearly as much as the <i>Post</i> or <i>Collier&#x2019;s</i>.&nbsp; Two of the stories in this volume first appeared in <i>Scribner&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, put out by the firm that published <i>This Side of Paradise.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These stories show an astonishing range. "The Offshore Pirate" is a light romance while "Bernice Bobs Her Hair,&#x201d; another flapper story, is harsher. In "May Day," Fitzgerald weaves three different plot strands among eleven episodes without missing a step. "Mr. Icky" is pure Dada, while "O Russet Witch!" is Magical Realism several decades before the genre was officially invented. "The Cut Glass Bowl" is in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe or even Stephen King. "Tarquin of Cheapside," with its accusation that William Shakespeare was a rapist, so shocked Maxwell Perkins that he wanted to leave the story out of the collection. &#x201c;Dalyrimple Goes Wrong,&#x201d; an inverted Horatio Alger story indicting capitalism and politics, would have offended a mass American audience. Stories like &#x201c;Tarquin of Cheapside&#x201d; and &#x201c;A Diamond as Big as the Ritz,&#x201d; similarly too cynical for the &#x201c;slicks,&#x201d; found their audience in <i>The Smart Set</i>. &#x201c;Benediction,&#x201d; also a <i>Smart Set</i> story, shows a girl who under the sway of an ecstatic religious experience nearly renounces her sweetheart, but leaves us with some doubt about her real feelings. The stories of young love (even when they foreshadow an ultimate disillusion) were the kind of fiction that the largely female audience of the <i>Post</i> and <i>Collier&#x2019;s</i> avidly read. Fitzgerald quickly learned that editors wanted the happy ending: a romantic farce like &#x201c;The Camel&#x2019;s Back&#x201d; ends&#x2014;as the formula requires&#x2014;with a wedding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fitzgerald sometimes groups several stories around a single theme. Tightly related stories such as &#x201c;The Ice Palace&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Jelly Bean&#x201d; even share a character (although Fitzgerald had to change Sally Carrol&#x2019;s last name from Happer to Hopper when the second story appeared in a different magazine).&nbsp; With this pairing, for example, Fitzgerald shows us the difference between the American Midwest, his own region, and the South, to which he had a sentimental attachment. &#x201c;The Four Fists,&#x201d; is a tale of a young man&#x2019;s maturing through hard knocks, and in &#x201c;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&#x201d; a man born old reverses the normal course of a lifetime and regresses to babyhood. &#x201c;Head and Shoulders&#x201d; depicts a married couple so oddly matched that they virtually morph into one another, while &#x201c;The Lees of Happiness&#x201d; offers another couple who are clearly meant for one another but whose bond does not lead to marriage. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fitzgerald&#x2019;s stories were so popular that Scribner&#x2019;s published hardcover collections almost immediately after they had appeared in magazines. <i>Flappers and Philosophers</i> came out in September 1920 with six additional printings in two years. A <i>New York Times</i> reviewer praised Fitzgerald&#x2019;s talent and genius: &#x201c;Mr. Fitzgerald is working out an idiom, and it is an idiom at once universal, American, and individual.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Tales of the Jazz Age</i> was published in September 1922 with Fitzgerald&#x2019;s choice of rubrics and droll comments on each story, which also appear in this edition. The <i>Times</i> reviewer of the collection wrote, &#x201c;If ever a writer was born with a gold pen in his mouth, surely Fitzgerald is that man. The more you read him, the more he convinces you that here is the destined artist.&#x201d; The <i>Denver Post</i>&#x2019;s critic called Fitzgerald&#x2019;s insight into the minds of the younger generation &#x201c;nothing less than amazing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fitzgerald had a proprietary feeling toward &#x201c;his material,&#x201d; what the <i>Times</i> called his &#x201c;idiom.&#x201d; He exploited his acquaintance with the white upper classes: the rich, the superrich, and the diamond-as-big-as-the-Ritz rich. His work incorporates timeless elements of romance, allegory, folk, and Gothic tales. The Midwest, the heartland of the American Dream, is a theme in many of his novels and stories (<i>The Great Gatsby, </i>&#x201c;The Ice Palace,&#x201d; &#x201c;Bernice Bobs Her Hair,&#x201d; for example), even those written in New York, Paris, or Los Angeles.</p>&lt;...</p><h2>The Day John Met Paul: An Hour-By-Hour Account of How the Beatles Began</h2><p>Beginning in the hours before dawn, O'Donnell tells the story of this historic meeting, and the deeper story of how each boy was brought to this moment when music took control of their lives. In the early evening, Paul pulled out his guitar and ran through a medley of tunes for John, impressing the young leader of the Quarry Men Skiffle Group with both his playing and his knowledge of rock music. One of the most important partnerships in the history of modern music was begun.<br>The Day John Met Paul is the story of two spirited boys on the brink of manhood who recognized a shared passion, a feeling for music so intense and pure that their seemingly simple meeting ultimately changed the face of music - and the world.</p><p><p>Jim O'Donnell is a veteran journalist and author. His books include <em>The Rock Book</em>, <em>Born to Rock</em> and <em>Wonderful Tonight</em>. He is editor of RockandRollJournal.com.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>Since the '60s, the Beatlemaniac has proven to be a different breed of rock fanatic, but even the most passionate of the Fab Four's cult eventually grew up to realize that the world didn't revolve around John, Paul, George and Ringo. O'Donnell (Wonderful Tonight) would do well to add that to his many notes. His eight years of intensive research among all variety of resources provide the reader with an overwhelming panorama of what turns out to be a split-second glance into a pretty average summer day. And while O'Donnell's fictionalized portraits of the young Lennon and McCartney circa that fateful July 6 are charming enough, his book is never just about the young Beatles. O'Donnell has penned an eloquent if slow-going ode to 1957 and everything the least bit relevant-especially the weather. No matter how great their legacy, the Beatles have suffered enough secondhand speculation: they set out to write songs, not history. Their various personas are secure in a handful of movies and books better than this one (listed in O'Donnell's helpful bibliography). Meanwhile, their music continues to arrest the attention of new listeners, just as it did in the band's heyday. This attempt to glimpse the origin of that mystery presumes too much. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Book of Disquiet</h2><p><p>"There is a distinguished mind at work beneath the totally acceptable dullness of clerking.

Unpacking sixty years of nuclear history, Ritter shows that nuclear weapons have become such a fixture that they define present-day America on economic, military, political, and moral grounds. And despite fears of global nuclear proliferation, the greatest threat to international stability, Ritter argues, is the US's addiction to nuclear weapons.<p>Even in light of Barack Obama's historic speech in April 2009&#x2014;which called for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons&#x2014; America continues to guard a significant and dangerous nuclear stockpile. The notion that we are more secure with nuclear weapons is deeply entrenched in the American psyche&#x2014;and virulently protected by forces in the US establishment. As long as this paradigm persists, Ritter suggests, there will be no fundamental US policy change, and as such, no change in global nuclear proliferation.</p></p><p><b>Scott Ritter</b> served as Chief Weapons Inspector for the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq from 1991-1998.

In this wishful album dedicated to what used to be pretty and can still be, the world of the memsahib is glorified and eulogized. We get glamorous glimpses, for example, of Karen Blixen's old washbasin, her Danish bed and her Kenyan verandah; looks at smoky railways used by the British to "stitch together the Empire;" and an awful lot of wicker furniture, sometimes with 19th-century colonials sitting on it. Sepia tones cool the volume and its interior vistas, redolent of comfort sought when the sun shone too fiercely. This gracefully designed picture book, with historical background appended in sentences, may not aim to give a sense of past life lived, and really doesn't. But as a visual aid to an escapist ideal, it is sumptuous and sufficient. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trees of the Carolinian Forest: A Guide to Species, Their Ecology and Uses</h2><p><p> <i>An illustrated reference of selected Eastern North American trees.</i> </p><p> This book identifies the 74 unique tree species of Canada's Carolinian Zone, the temperate stretch of southern Ontario.

Dave Miller's dry, technically versed style has earned him widespread respect through his own publications as well as his work with <i>Brewing Techniques</i>, the first-rate magazine for small-scale brewers. Really an update to his classic Complete Handbook of Home Brewing, <i>Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide</i> is clear enough to introduce advanced techniques to the average home-brewer, yet thorough enough to provide a permanent reference for the expert. <p> Miller manages to improve upon his earlier book--itself one of the finest advanced brewing books available--by updating and better organizing the information. While the <i>Homebrewing Guide</i> does provide a cursory introduction to basic brewing techniques and a sampling of supplementary topics (kegging, filtration), its real value is in the thoroughness and clarity with which all-grain brewing is described. Grain mashing, for instance, is discussed in three different chapters: a summary of various mashing techniques, a description of the underlying biochemistry, and a step-by-step description of the mashing process. By compartmentalizing the information into short chapters and carefully organizing their sequence, Miller creates a guide that can be read straight through as an initiation to advanced brewing or easily referenced for specific information on brew day. <i>--Todd Gehman</i></p>It's here!

His poetry is as recognizably his own as his stories and like them evokes depths of meaning beneath a surface simplicity. In her moving introduction, Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, notes how often a particular poem calls to mind a corresponding story, and the reverse is also true. Indeed, to know Carver by his prose is to know him only partially. Master at illuminating those often mundane moments that starkly dramatize entire lives, Carver was also master at creating mood, and many of these poems have a striking lyrical intensity, especially when Carver unflinchingly faces death while celebrating life.

In seemingly every decade since the 1880s, America has tried new food trends from south of the border&#x2014;chili, tamales, tacos, enchiladas, tequila, bacon-wrapped hot dogs, and so many more&#x2014;loved them, and demanded the next great thing. As a result, Mexican food dominates American palates to the tune of billions of dollars in sales per year, from canned refried beans to frozen margaritas and ballpark nachos. It&#x2019;s a little-known history, one that&#x2019;s crept up on this country like your Mexican neighbors&#x2014;and left us better for it. <br><br>Now, <i>Taco USA </i>addresses the all-important questions: What exactly constitutes &#x201c;Mexican&#x201d; food in the United States? How did it get here? What&#x2019;s &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; and what&#x2019;s &#x201c;Taco Bell,&#x201d; and does it matter? What&#x2019;s so cosmic about a burrito?

They were astronauts on STS-128, a NASA mission that flew the <i>Discovery</i> space shuttle to rendezvous with the International Space Station on August 30, 2009. <i>Discovery</i>&#x2019;s seven-member crew spent ten days at the research station, primarily to resupply the people already up there and to rotate members. Olivas&#x2014;raised in El Paso, Texas&#x2014;went on a space walk to repair an ammonia tank, among other tasks; Hern�ndez&#x2014;who picked crops in California&#x2019;s Central Valley alongside family members as a child&#x2014;sent his thoughts to our planet <i>en espa�ol. &#x201c;Espero la cosecha de mi sue�o sirva como inspiracion a todos!&#x201d;</i> he enthused via Twitter. &#x201c;I hope the harvest of my dream serves as inspiration to all!&#x201d;<br> <br>On September 8, the <i>Discovery</i> crew undocked from the Space Station. It was morning. It was time for breakfast burritos. The rest of the crew had earlier asked Hern�ndez and Olivas if they might cook the meal, because Olivas was the NASA member who knew how to make them best. Of course. A video camera transmitted footage of the duo floating toward the galley of the middeck to open a shelf containing the ingredients needed to construct the cylindrical god in zero gravity: flour tortillas sealed in a vacuum pack, clumps of ready-to-eat scrambled eggs, and fat sausage patties.<br> <br>Olivas pulled out a tortilla, letting it float in front of him while tearing open a thumb-sized salsa packet. He smeared a smiley face on the tortilla and tried to roll it up; since it wasn&#x2019;t cooked, the flour flatbread bent into a U-shape but wobbled back into its outstretched natural state. Hern�ndez, meanwhile, opened a pouch that contained the patty. Olivas placed the tortilla near the meat, expecting the sausage to plop down on it, as it would on terra firma. Instead, the brownish, glistening mass popped out of the bag, away from the tortilla below it, and would&#x2019;ve presumably continued on an endless trajectory if the fast-thinking Olivas didn&#x2019;t snatch the sausage with the tortilla. The salsa acted as a binding agent and secured the incipient Icarus.<br> <br>The eggs proved more manageable. Hern�ndez cut them out of a packet; Olivas used a spoon to guide each minimound onto the tortilla, then promptly chopped them up into smaller pieces, the better to smush and smear&#x2014;if the tortilla might only bend. The moment of truth arrived: Olivas folded the vessel in half, wrapping one flap over the other, and rolled it tight. Success; a breakfast burrito was born, and more were on the way.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time burritos orbited Earth&#x2014;Olivas had made a batch on his previous visit to the Space Station two years earlier. In fact, NASA had used tortillas for astronaut sustenance as early as 1985, when Mexican scientist Rodolfo Neri Vela requested a pack as part of his food provisions, to make tacos. The media treated Neri&#x2019;s food choices at the time with bemusement, but astronauts quickly took to flour tortillas&#x2014;and not just because of the flavor, redolent of flour and slightly sweet, better than most of the sterilized slop astronauts ate. Tortillas didn&#x2019;t spoil easily. Astronauts could wrap one around anything and make a quick meal. They also weren&#x2019;t dangerous, like bread, whose crumbs crippled air vents and sensitive equipment.<br> <br>NASA took tortillas so seriously that they tinkered with the recipe&#x2014;which hadn&#x2019;t substantially changed in millennia save for the introduction of flour&#x2014;to keep stacks fresh for up to six months. Scientists created a nitrogen-filled packet that removed almost all the oxygen present in the pouch, to prevent mold from growing. One major problem arose: astronauts discovered that six-month-old space tortillas became bitter&#x2014;and <i>no one</i> deserves a bitter tortilla. Finally, NASA found a manufacturer who made an extended-shelf-life tortilla that lasted up to a year and retained its allure, a maker that also sold their product to fast-food titan Taco Bell. Hundreds of thousands of dollars well spent.<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot think of anything that cannot be put on a tortilla, or has not been put on a tortilla,&#x201d; wrote Sandra Magnus, a veteran astronaut, in a blog post while up in the International Space Station in 2008. &#x201c;When a Shuttle shows up you are in tortilla heaven because they show up with tons of them and graciously donate all of the extras to the ISS crews. You really want to be swimming in tortillas your whole increment.&#x201d;1<br> <br>And for short missions of five to seven days? Astronauts often bring their flour tortillas fresh from a Houston <i>tortiller�a</i>&#x2014;a tortilla factory. No customizing, no chemicals&#x2014;just unadulterated rapture. The perfect food.<br> <br>&#x201c;Danny is an expert in zero-g burrito making,&#x201d; Hern�ndez radioed to Mission Control after their burrito party. It was a mission of celebration: never had two Mexican-Americans flown up in space on the same mission, and never did burritos shine so brightly. Sure, Hern�ndez and Olivas offered a service to their crewmates that hundreds of thousands of their fellow Mexican provided daily back on Earth&#x2014;prepping Mexican food for Americans more than happy to gobble it up. Their feast made the news; a video soon went viral across the Internet, the astronauts&#x2019; beaming, proud smiles as they hoisted their fast food for humanity to see. So high in the heavens, up above the world, the burrito not only had become universal&#x2014;it was now, finally, truly, cosmic.<br><br>Mexican food is at our state dinners, in elegant presentations. Mexican food is in our school cafeterias, packaged as chimichangas or in bags of Fritos, in convenience stores heating on rolling racks, waiting for the hands of hurried customers. Mexican food sponsors college bowl games such as the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl and buys naming rights for sporting venues such as the Taco Bell Arena at Boise State in Idaho. Mexican food commercials blanket television airwaves hawking salsa and hard-shelled taco packets and high-priced tequilas and imported beers promising a day at the beach. Mexican food fills our grocery aisles, feeds underclassmen, sits in our freezers and pantries, is the focus of festivals, becomes tween trends or front-page news&#x2014;and if you don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m talking about, ask your kid about spaghetti tacos.<br> <br>That wonderful culinary metaphor the melting pot has absorbed Mexican in this country just like so many immigrant cuisines of the past&#x2014;but in a demanding way, unique from other traditions that have penetrated the American palate. While there are more Chinese restaurants than Mexican in this country, Mexican food is the easier sell&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t see hundreds of different soy sauce brands sold at supermarkets like you do hot sauce, or General Tso&#x2019;s chicken cook-offs at your local community fair like you do with bowls of chili. While pizza is the bestselling and farthest-reaching item of Italian-American cuisine, its rise and that of pasta and subs is only relatively recent; the United States, on the other hand, has loved Mexican food for more than 125 years&#x2014;bought it, sold it, made it, spread it, supplied it, cooked it, savored it, loved it.<br> <br><i>Comida mexicana</i> in the United States is like M. C. Escher&#x2019;s <i>Relativity,</i> each staircase helping the climber reach a particular plateau but only to whisper promises of higher, better planes, in an endless hat dance of discovery. Americans have defined Mexican food as combo platters and enchiladas, margaritas and guacamole, tortilla chips and actual tortillas, frozen burritos and burritos made to order. Mom-and-pop shops and multinationals. Taco carts and tamale men. Taco trucks operating under cover of night and luxe-<i>loncheras</i> that tweet their latest specials. Beans, rice, carne asada, soyrizo. All of it absorbed by Americans, enjoyed, demanded&#x2014;and all of it whetting appetites for more. And with this country&#x2019;s latest Great Migration stretching brown folks beyond the American Southwest and to all fifty states, in virtually all metropolitan areas, from the prairies and flatlands of the Midwest to Maine&#x2019;s rocky shores, Alaska&#x2019;s tundra to the Florida Keys, we&#x2019;re experiencing a renaissance of Mexican food&#x2014;a perpetual foreigner perfectly at home.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve had generations of Americans who scarf down tacos and burritos like previous generations forked through chicken pot pies and ate pastrami on rye. And that&#x2019;s just the United States: as globalization sets in, so does Mexican food. Mexican restaurants operate across Europe, in Turkey, in Nepal and Addis Ababa. Down under, Taco Bill&#x2019;s has sold Australians fish tacos for nearly twenty-five years. Sometimes it&#x2019;s Mexicans who run these restaurants; many times it&#x2019;s American expats. Sometimes the locals dine there, but it&#x2019;s often American tourists who patronize the places, seeking a taste of home. It&#x2019;s too easy to say Mexican food is an all-American food: to say as much is to ignore the tortured relationship between Mexicans and their adopted country. But Mexican food is as much of an ambassador for the United States as the hot dog, whether either country wants to admit it or not.<br> <br>Let me give <i>ustedes</i> an example. Tom Tancredo doesn&#x2019;t like Mexicans&#x2014;no way, no how, no <i>duh</i>. The former Colorado Republican congressman and onetime presidential candidate spent most of his political career railing against a supposed invasion of the United States by Mexico&#x2014;and while intelligent minds can disagree about unchecked migration to this country, Tancredo flat-out feels Mexicans are downright deficient.<br> <br>In November 2010, we debated in Denver about whether Mexicans ever assimilate. I maintained that we do; Tancredo didn&#x2019;t accept the possibility, yet never explained how someone like myself&#x2014;who spoke only Spanish when I entered kindergarten; was the child of two Mexican immigrants, one of whom came into this country in the trunk of a Chevy; and who now favors English and Chuck Taylor All-Stars&#x2014;did it. The back-and-forth squabble happened at Su Teatro, an old movie house now housing one of the most vibrant Chicano theaters in the United States. There is no need to go into the details of our discussion, except for one pertinent point: before lambasting Mexicans and our supposed refusal to join American society, Tancredo joined me for a Mexican dinner.<br> <br>The restaurant was across the street from Su Teatro: El Noa Noa, a large eatery that advertises itself as the Mile High City&#x2019;s &#x201c;best and most authentic Mexican restaurant.&#x201d; At night, Art Deco&#x2013;style neon lights flash the restaurant&#x2019;s name on its marquee, a reference to a legendary nightclub in Ciudad Ju�rez that was the subject of a famous Mexican song. A party on your plate. The atmosphere isn&#x2019;t aggressively ethnic: no strolling mariachis or women fluttering fans and eyelids. Eaters sit; waiters bring out a plate of chips and salsa and fetch drinks. People of all nationalities come in to eat, though the clientele leans more to American than Mexican.<br> <br>Tancredo and I sat down near the middle of the restaurant; Patty Calhoun, editor of <i>Westword</i> (the city&#x2019;s alternative weekly, which carries my &#x201c;�Ask a Mexican!&#x201d; column), and others joined us. We traded small talk, saving our salvos for the discussion to come&#x2014;but around us, tables whispered, fingers pointed. Some people approached our table to greet Tancredo, wish him luck for the evening. Another woman offered her appreciation for my upcoming public confrontation of someone she considered a living embodiment of Satan. She wanted to make a scene, but her chile relleno supper was getting cold.<br> <br>Our plates came. I drank tequila, of course; Tancredo, a dry red wine. He ordered the tamale dinner, hold the rice. Two of them, slathered (or, as more accurately stated in the Denver lexicon, &#x201c;smothered&#x201d;) in green chile, each as long as a palm, as thick as a copy of this book, sat before him. They shimmered with the dabs of lard needed to make a tamale moist and more than mere cornmeal and shredded pork. I stole bites of the same plate from Calhoun. Soft, spicy, filling. The pork&#x2019;s sweet essence melted on my palate; the green chile piqued toward the end. These weren&#x2019;t the tamales of my youth&#x2014;they were smaller, but that was okay. The chile&#x2014;borne from the fertile soil of southern Colorado&#x2014;seared differently from the Mexican chiles I grew up on and were so flavorful, they needed no extra salsa.<br> <br>Tancredo thought so as well. He polished off the plate, laughing and talking between each bite, getting fueled for a night to decry the very culture that had just fed him. More than a year later, I can only recall some of the points of our philosophical fisticuffs, but the scene I can&#x2019;t get out of my head is Tancredo&#x2019;s ear-to-ear, tamale-induced smile. Tom Tancredo may not like Mexicans, but he sure loves his Mexican food. <i>Of course</i> he does.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not just Tom who holds this contradictory position. From the early days of Mexico&#x2019;s birth in 1810, when our young country longingly looked west toward its newly christened southern neighbor&#x2019;s vast territories, lonely and so full of potential, Mexican food has entranced Americans even while Mexicans have perplexed Americans. In the history of Mexican food in this country you&#x2019;ll find the twisted, fascinating history of two peoples, Mexicans and Americans, fighting, arguing, but ultimately accepting each other, if only in the comfort of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The greatest apostles of Mexican food in this country haven&#x2019;t been Mexicans but rather Americans who, having tasted from the bread of life that is a steaming taco, a pot of menudo, or a foil-wrapped burrito, sought to proclaim its gospel with every new unearthing. While we&#x2019;ve long quarreled with Mexico over seemingly everything, we&#x2019;ve always embraced the food, wanting to experience the &#x201c;authenticity&#x201d; of the other half: enjoying the meals Aztec emperors might have feasted on before meeting their fate, dining before handsome bronze-skinned waiters and pretty se�oritas, eating like a Mexican might eat on the street, in poverty back in Mexico, in the cantina, through cookbooks, canned products, classes, trips to the motherland or the local <i>taquer�a</i>&#x2014;but always within the prism of America. That consumption hasn&#x2019;t always been pretty: caricatures of hot tamales, Montezuma&#x2019;s revenge, questionable ingredients, Frito Banditos, talking Chihuahuas, and sleeping peons litter the landscape and continue to influence American perceptions of Mexican food and of Mexicans. But even negative stereotypes and digestive concerns never stopped our collective yen for the stuff.<br> <br>Mexican food&#x2019;s American journey is obviously personal to me. I consider tortillas and hot sauce as essential to life as oxygen, walk through the day with a bag of Serrano peppers in my pocket, have served as a food editor for a newspaper for nearly a decade, and have always pushed my paper to treat Mexican food seriously. My fondest childhood memories usually involve smuggled cheese wheels from my parents&#x2019; ancestral villages; my mom was a tomato canner and got up early in the morning to make us a Mexican breakfast of eggs and beans, went to work, and returned in the evening with the wherewithal to make us a full meal for dinner. Mexican food is a way of life, which isn&#x2019;t a surprise, of course. But that so many Americans, with no blood ties to Mexico, who might not even like the country, revere my cuisine? The reporter in me is fascinated; the Mexican in me, flabbergasted.<br> <br>This book isn&#x2019;t about me, though: it&#x2019;s about a food that deserves documentation, examination, celebration, and to be hailed as the epic it is. While Mexican culinary culture is an unquestioned part...</p><h2>Rocks &amp; Minerals (Audubon Guides)</h2><p>The budding mineralogist will find the photos and spotter&#39;s guide section of this sturdy field guide useful for identifying and categorizing minerals found in the backyard and throughout North America. Simultaneous.</p><p>This book is part of a series of guides designed for adolescents interested in natural history and nature. The books are an excellent introduction to the <i>Rocks and Minerals</i>, <i>Birds</i>, <i>Wildflowers</i>, and <i>Insects</i> for children aged 8-18. Each guide is appropriately sized to fit in a field vest pocket. Readers who remember previous versions of these field guides from the 1970s that were dull and overly detailed will be pleasantly surprised. These books are arguably the most beautifully photographed and laid out field guides yet published for young people. Each book has an introductory section filled with interesting facts, descriptions of early naturalists, definitions of many of the terms used in the book, and a guide to using the field guide portion of the book. Best of all, the books also come equipped with laminated field "cheat sheet" cards, for quick identification while on the go, in any kind of weather. Each field guide features 50 common specimens with photos and brief descriptions of many more regionally occurring rocks and minerals. Brief discussions of threatened and endangered species are particularly valuable. Great first guides for children and adults with limited natural history background.<p> The <i>Rocks and Minerals</i> guide has excellent photographs and descriptions of many minerals and rock types. Most junior naturalists will never see mineral crystals in the field as shown in the photographs, but the guide gives a good understanding of where and how these minerals formed. <i>--Merri Martz</i></p>Grade 5 Up-These handsome books, illustrated with vibrant, full-color photographs, have a lot to offer, but calling them "first field guides" is somewhat misleading. They assume some previous knowledge and background vocabulary, and are not designed to give users quick reference to found items. Instead, they introduce their respective subjects and offer tips on equipment and observation. "How to look" sections give the basic science behind the fields of study. Then come the actual guides, which contain photographs of 50 common wildflowers or rocks and other similar species or formations. Boxed inserts detail the specific information. In Wildflowers, each entry lists what to look for, leaves, height, when the flower blooms, habitat, range, and cautions (when applicable). For Rocks, the boxed inserts give the mineral composition, texture, color, and environment. Each book concludes with an illustrated glossary; Wildflowers includes pictures of the 50 state flowers. Both titles have current lists for further reading that cover a wide range of reading levels and include Web sites. These are attractive and useful additions, but are not stand-alone field guides, per se.<br><i>Kathryn Kosiorek, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Successful Berry Growing: How to Plant, Prune, Pick and Preserve Bush and Vine Fruits</h2><p><p>A garden without berries is like spring without flowers.

Katie Scarlett O'Hara, the headstrong, passionate woman whose life is inextricably entwined with Rhett's: more like him than she cares to admit; more in love with him than she'll ever know...</p><p>Brought to vivid and authentic life by the hand of a master, <i>Rhett Butler's People</i> fulfills the dreams of those whose imaginations have been indelibly marked by <i>Gone With The Wind</i>.</p></p><p>Margaret Mitchell's story of Scarlett O'Hara's and Rhett Butler's beguiling, twisted love for each other, set against the gruesome background of a nation torn apart by war, is by all accounts epic--so much so that it feels untouchable. Yet McCaig's take on what many would consider a sacred cow of 20th-century American literature is a worthy suitor for Mitchell's many ardent fans, for reasons that may not be altogether obvious. It would be easy to look at <i>Gone With the Wind</i> and <i>Rhett Butler&#x2019;s People</i> side by side and catalog what is accurate and what isn't and tally up the score. In doing so, however, the fan is apt to miss out on the best part of this whole book: Rhett Butler himself. McCaig's Rhett is thoroughly modern, both a product of his Charleston plantation and an emphatic rejection of it. He is filled with romance and ingenuity, grit and wit, and a toughness matched only by a sense of humility that evokes so gracefully the hardship and heartbreak of a society falling apart. It's not hard to love Rhett in his weakness for Scarlett's love, but it is entirely amazing to love him as he rescues Belle Watling, mentors her bright young son Tazewell, adores his sister Rosemary, dotes on dear Bonnie Blue, and defends his best friend Tunis Bonneau to the very end.<p></p> <p>To pluck a character from a beloved book and recalibrate the story's point-of-view isn't an easy thing to do. Ultimately, the new must ring true with the old, and this is where <i>Rhett Butler&#x2019;s People</i> succeeds beyond measure. In the spirit of Mitchell's masterpiece, McCaig never questions that love--of family, lover, land, or country--is the tie that binds these characters to life, for better or worse. --<i>Anne Bartholomew</i></p><br><p><b>Rhett Butler</b></p><p><i>Renegade.

Here he matches his personal experience with his experiences treating other patients with the disease, the result is real hope for good health. Cram is a firm believer in four elements to self-help: a positive attitude, information about the disease; partnership with a knowledgeable physician, and a willingness to take action, to do the things ``that make you feel better, help slow the disability, and keep you as independent as possible for as long as possible.'' Thus, he first explains the disease: its hallmarks are trembling in the hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; stiffness and rigidity of the limbs and torso; slowness of movement; and impaired balance and coordination. There are other possible symptoms, from depression to changes in speech. Cram goes on to explain the overall progression of the disease through five stages. The hope he offers is that early self-help and medication may delay or even prevent the later stages. He looks at length at emotional considerations, diet, exercise, and other lifestyle needs, as well as present and possible future medical treatments. Cram also is careful to include practical help and encouragement for caregivers. Kind, practical, and thorough, a valuable starting point. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Pursued by deadly spies and assassins, the Cimmerian and Valeria find themselves caught squarely in the front ranks of a bloody and savage war. But greater peril lurks in the shadow of a vast and forbidding mountain, where the Spirit Speaker wage occult battle with God-Men, who can read the future--and summon a Living Wind that consumes the soul even as it destroys the flesh.<br><br>Even a sword powered by barbarian might is of little use against spirits, much less against great beings of the elder dark, but the final struggle for survival will come down ton...Conan and the Gods of the Mountain<br></p><p>One<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the forest between dead Xuchotl and the foot of Thunder Mountain, the boot-wearers whose tracks the hunter had seen followed a game trail.<br>One was a woman, and no southern hills or forests had ever been birthplace to one so fair of skin and hair. She wore a shirt and trousers of silk that had once been whole and white, but were now neither. Rents in both displayed the fairness of her skin; and a rag of red silk bound up her hair. The garb, though tattered, still fitted snugly enough to display the splendor of her breasts and hips.<br>Her boots had the look of the sea about them. They were of supple leather, with wide-flaring tops, easily kicked off if one found one's self in the water. That they were not made for tramping game trails in the Black Kingdoms was evident by how often the woman gritted her teeth.<br>About her slender waist a silken sash upheld a well-used sword and two knives. One knife was a seaman's dirk, the other a keen-edged dagger whose hilt writhed with creatures out of nightmare.<br>The woman was tall and robustly formed, yet her companion overtopped her by more than a head, and his muscles told of a giant's strength to go with that stature. He was similarly clad, with the difference that his sword was stouter and hung from a broad leather belt, along with three knives. His hair was black, flowing freely across his broad shoulders, and his eyes were of an icy blue, with the look of the north to them.<br>Those eyes had been the last sight of more than a few men over the years. The tall man was Conan the Cimmerian, his companion Valeria of the Red Brotherhood. They owed their garb to having once been pirates in Baracha, and their companionship to many curious circumstances.<br>Most important of those was the battle they had fought for their lives within the walls of Xuchotl. It was waged against enemies both animal and human, armed with both steel and spells. In the end, it had cleansed the accursed city of the very last of its bloody, unnatural life.<br>It had also given each of them a dagger. Nothing else would they take from Xuchotl, knowing too many of the city's secrets to trust loot removed from its halls. Those halls reeked of blood shed and spells cast over many centuries, and terror that would echo in their green-lit vastness when the bones of the dead were dust on the floors of polished stone.<br>Conan had traveled in the Black Kingdoms before, if not in this jungle, then in others hardly less friendly. He feared neither man nor beast. Yet had the Kwanyi hunter seen the wanderer of Cimmeria, he would have laughed...for Conan also threw more than a few glances over his shoulder to see what remnant of Xuchotl's evil might be on his trail.<br>* * *<br>It was taboo among the Kwanyi to leave the dead in the place where they died, no matter how great the burden of removing the body. Left where the spirit departed from it, the body might be found again by that same spirit and become a <i>yaquele</i>, one of the "walking dead."<br>So from the time they could bear a burden, the folk of the Kwanyi learned to make litters of whatever came ready to hand. Saplings, vines, even the leaves of the smokebush, had their uses.<br>A litter able to bear the dead was also fit for the living who could not walk. The hunter was moving again in less time than it would have taken him to empty a gourd of beer. Two of the Monkey hunters bore him on level ground, trailed by the third, while the leader strode on ahead.<br>The hunter noted that the leader bore his spear in both hands, held across his chest ready to either throw or thrust. This was a hunting party, so the men bore no shields, but it seemed that the leader did not expect their visit to Thunder Mountain to be entirely peaceful.<br>It further seemed that he wanted their presence to be unnoticed. Twice he raised hand and spear to halt all movement. Once he used the hunters' hand signals to send them all into a thick stand of smokebush.<br>The hunter had no notion of what they were hiding from, or why, although at the first halt he heard the chatter of women and the clatter of jars in vine nets slung across their backs. No doubt it was a band of the brew-sisters, taking jars of grain to the brew-house, or perhaps beer down from it. So what made the leader as careful not to be seen by them as he would if they were a war party of the Ichiribu?<br>The hunter had no answer, or at least none to lift a man's spirits. He thought of reminding the leader that the God-Men might know that the hunter had asked to come to them.<br>Would the Monkey warriors presume to deny the wishes of the God-Men? Or where they carrying out the wishes of the God-Men by carrying him up the mountain in secret?<br>* * *<br>Valeria leaned back against a tree of a kind Conan had never seen before. Its bark was a nubbly mass of red-and-white stripes, with mold and mushrooms sprouting in cracks between the stripes. It looked unwholesome to the Cimmerian's eyes, but he reminded himself that might be merely because the tree was unknown to him.<br>He was not without experience in the Black Kingdoms. Indeed, he had sat on a throne in them and been hailed with the praise-name of Amra the Lion. But that was farther south and west than here, not a two-day march from Xuchotl. In time, they might reach lands that Conan knew, or even realms where he was known, but they faced a long journey before they did.<br>Meanwhile, the Cimmerian had less knowledge than he could wish of this land and its perils. To be sure, no peril of the jungle could equal what he and Valeria had faced and survived in Xuchotl. Nor did Conan lack any woods craft or hunting skills such that might keep a man alive though he were cast down naked in a desert.<br>But Valeria was like a fish out of water in this jungle, or rather, a sailor far from the sea. She would doubtless prefer the rack than admit it, but she was trusting Conan to lead them both to the sea once more.<br>She sighed and kicked off first one boot, then the other. Rubbing her battered feet, she looked about for a stream. None lay close, but a puddle of water from the last rain offered hope.<br>One slender foot was dipping toward the water when Conan laid a hand on Valeria's shoulder. "Best leave standing water alone. Those blisters might fester or draw leeches."<br>"They are my blisters, Conan."<br>"Yes, and it will be my back that bears your weight if you cannot walk. Or would you rather I left you behind?"<br>That was the Cimmerian's rough jest. From the way Valeria's hand darted toward her Xuchotl blade, it seemed that the jest was lost on her.<br>"Peace, woman. I was joking."<br>"Your wit smells no sweeter than the rest of you."<br>"Take a whiff of yourself, woman, before you complain of another's smell. Either of us walking into the Golden Anchor in Messantia would clear the place in a heartbeat."<br>Valeria smiled thinly and kept her feet clear of the puddle. Instead, she pulled a handful of leaves from a low-hanging branch and dipped them in the water.<br>"Best not do that either," Conan said. "A blind man looking at the branch could tell that people had passed by."<br>"And what would this blind man do with the knowledge?" Valeria snapped. At least she did not reach for steel this time.<br>"If I knew that, I would know which way we should go to keep him or his friends off our trail," the Cimmerian said. "It might slow us a trifle, but--"<br>"Would to Mitra it did slow us!" Valeria said. She looked at her boots as if they had offered her a mortal insult. "Anyone would think from the way you've been driving us along that a whole new tribe of those brown-skinned cutthroats and spellmongers was on our trail."<br>"I can't swear that they aren't," Conan said, then added hastily as Valeria's eyes flamed, "but I'd wager against it. If you hadn't insisted that we search for our clothes, we'd have been out of Xuchotl--"<br>"If I hadn't insisted on finding our clothes--you know how I was garbed."<br>The Cimmerian grinned. "More sightly than you are now, I swear. Of course--"<br>Valeria rolled her blue eyes toward the canopy of the jungle with the look of a woman tried beyond speech and endurance. Then she sighed. "Of course it was quite unsuitable for tramping about in the jungle." That was certainly true enough, as the garb had been a swathe of silken cloth about her hips and not a rag more.<br>"And the folk of Xuchotl had nothing much better in their wardrobes," she added. "What else could we have done?"<br>"Nothing, I admit. But it took us time we could have used to put distance between ourselves and the city. We still have that to do, and the sooner, the better."<br>"Is that a hint we should be on our way again?"<br>"With you, Valeria, I can only hint. Crom alone knows what you would do if you thought I was giving you an <i>order</i>!"<br>Valeria rolled her eyes again, and this time she stuck out her tongue as well. But she also lurched to her feet and eased into her boots. She could not entirely stifle a gasp of pain, but Conan paid her the compliment of letting her finish the work herself.<br>The Cimmerian added to the curses he had already heaped on the folk of Xuchotl, this one for their wretched footgear. Only sandals--suited to their polished floors--had been in use for more years than the Cimmerian had lived. The sailors' boots he and Valeria had worn going into Xuchotl had been the best things to bring them out again.<br>But no one could deny that those boots were not made for walking fast and far. In another day or two, he might well need to think of finding better footgear, a hiding place where they could let pursuit pass by, or a trail over which Valeria could walk barefoot.<br>The Cimmerian's own soles were leather-tough and had resisted the burning sands of the deserts of Iranistan, but Valeria of the Red Brotherhood was more at home on a ship's deck. Another day or two of tramping these trails in such footgear and she might truly need to be carried.<br>Nor was that the only matter preying on the Cimmerian's mind. They had taken no food from Xuchotl, fearing poison or sorcery. They would have to find victuals before long. A three-day fast was less than wise, even for the Cimmerian, when hard marching, and perhaps fighting, lay ahead.<br>At least he could be sure of the woman beside him. Her courage and skill with weapons she had amply demonstrated, and not only in Xuchotl. That she had survived at all for so many years in the Red Brotherhood proved her no common warrior. She might lack the Cimmerian's woods craft, but that could be learned, and again, Valeria's being alive at all was proof that she learned swiftly when need be.<br>Would she learn swiftly enough? Only the gods knew, and Conan had given up expecting answers from them in good season. A fine sword, a trustworthy companion--and stout boots--were worth all the priests' prayers that Conan had ever heard.<br>Ahead, sunlight broke through the forest's canopy to tint a patch of dead leaves the color of old gold. Conan shaded his eyes with one hand and stared upward. As best he could judge, it was not long past noon.<br>"We'll see about stopping well before twilight," he said without turning. "Sooner, if we find a good hiding place with clean water. I'll set snares, and we can forage for fruits and berries while we wait for the game to find its way to the traps. You're handy enough with knots, I trust?"<br>"A sailor so long, and clumsy with knots? Conan, you have seagull dung where other men have their wits!"<br>Yet he could hear beneath the indignation relief and gratitude. Valeria would die before admitting either, of course, so it was best if she never had to.<br>As for the Cimmerian, he would rather die than leave Valeria. He had snatched her from the nightmare halls of Xuchotl, saving her from becoming a sacrifice on behalf of the aged witch Tascela. He would not be done until they reached not merely the coast, but the sight of a Hyborian ship. Between them and that happy moment lay Crom only knew what perils.<br>Crom only knew--and of all the gods Conan had ever heard of, the cold, grim lord of the Cimmerians was the least likely to answer the questions of mewling humans.<br>* * *<br>It took all four Monkey warriors now to carry the hunter's litter. They were well up the slopes of Thun der Mountain, although not on any trail the hunter remembered. This proved little, as he had been this far up the mountain only four times in his life, for ordeals and ceremonies that demanded the presence of God-Men.<br>He still would have gladly walked, even with the help of a staff, or with a <i>tuqa</i> leaf to ease the pain of his ankle. He cared little for the sweat and sore muscles of the Monkey warriors, but he cared very much about not being helpless. He thought of asking for the staff and a wad of the painkilling leaves, but one look at the grim face of the Monkey leader slew that thought at once. The Monkey warrior might have been the image of a <i>yaquele</i>, save for the sweat flowing down him.<br>Also, the hunter knew he could not walk far even with such aid without risking damage to his ankle beyond the powers of the God-Men to heal. The Kwanyi had small use for a hunter who could no longer hunt. He would be as a child so young that he had no right to anything--not even to food should it grow scarce. The worst that the God-Men or the Monkey leader--even Chabano himself--might do would be swifter, less painful, and more honorable than such a fate.<br>The hunter lay back and closed his eyes. Presently he felt the soft, cold touch of mist on his cheek and heard the cry of the mountain eagle as it soared in the chill sky found only above the tree line.<br>* * *<br>Conan's long arm whipped the sling up and over. At the high point of its arc, the slung stone leaped across the little stream and into the monkey-laden tree on the other side. The monkeys' chattering turned into shrieks of rage and fear. They scattered, leaves, twigs, and birds' nests tumbling in their wake.<br>One monkey neither cried out nor fled. Struck a deadly blow by the stone, it toppled from its branch, bounced from a second, then stuck firmly in the crotch of a third. From ground to the dead monkey was the height of six men taller than Conan.<br>The Cimmerian cursed the whole race of monkeys and the inventor of the sling. Then he saw that Valeria was kicking off her boots.<br>"Guard my back, Conan. I will have our dinner down in a trice."<br>Warned of leeches, Valeria leaped the stream, though Conan saw her wince at the pain this gave her feet. Then she was climbing the tree with almost the agility of the vanished monkeys, in the manner Conan had seen on the Black Coasts--body and legs at nearly right angles, arms gripping the tree as if it were a lover, well-formed hindquarters in the air.<br>She moved surely, fingers and toes seeking out the tiniest rough patches in the bark. The angle of the trunk was just enough to allow her to climb as she did, and it was not long before she reached the monkey. A slap to the branch did nothing; the branch was too thick. Valeria climbed another arm's length, crawled out onto the branch, and pushed the dead monkey off.<br>It thumped into a patch of ferns. Conan crossed the stream, thrust his sword into the patch, and withdrew it with the monkey spitted on the point.<br>"What is there to make you uneasy?" Valeria called.<br>"In this jungle, less than ferns can hide se..."High quality...Green provides a colorful adventure."--<i>Science Fiction Chronicle</i><br></p><h2>The Oxford Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology</h2><p>Featuring illustrations, a map, and an in-depth index, an authoritative guide delves into the intriguing world of Ancient Egypt, providing entries--each written by a renowned Egyptologist--on deities, burial practices, cults, demons, animals, magic, oracles, sacred writings, festivals, and much more.

There she led a life of unimaginable privilege and luxury alongside the king's own daughter. King Hassan II ascended the throne following Muhammad V's death, and in 1972 General Oufkir was found guilty of treason after staging a coup against the new regime, and was summarily executed. Immediately afterward, Malika, her mother, and her five siblings were arrested and imprisoned, despite having no prior knowledge of the coup attempt. <p>They were first held in an abandoned fort, where they ate moderately well and were allowed to keep some of their fine clothing and books. Conditions steadily deteriorated, and the family was eventually transferred to a remote desert prison, where they suffered a decade of solitary confinement, torture, starvation, and the complete absence of sunlight. Oufkir's horrifying descriptions of the conditions are mesmerizing, particularly when contrasted with her earlier life in the royal court, and many graphic images will long haunt readers. Finally, teetering on the edge of madness and aware that they had been left to die, Oufkir and her siblings managed to tunnel out using their bare hands and teaspoons, only to be caught days later. Her account of their final flight to freedom makes for breathtaking reading. <i>Stolen Lives</i> is a remarkable book of unfathomable deprivation and the power of the human will to survive.</p>Malika Oufkir lives in Paris.

Written on tiny pieces of rice paper tucked into canisters and tied to the birds&#x2019; legs, these messages were sometimes comic, often tragic, and occasionally invaluable&#x2014;reporting details of German troop movements and fortifications, new Nazi weapons, radar systems, and even the deployment of the feared V-1 and V-2 rockets used to terrorize London.</p><p>The people who sent these messages were not trained spies.

As part of a spy operation code-named Columba, the Allied forces amassed sixteen thousand highly trained homing pigeons and dropped them in an arc across Nazi-occupied Europe. Returning to the secret government branch in charge of the &#x201c;Special Pigeon Service,&#x201d; the birds carried messages written on tiny pieces of rice paper tucked into canisters and tied to the patient birds&#x2019; legs. These messages were sometimes comic, often tragic and occasionally invaluable&#x2014;reporting details of German troop movements and fortifications, new Nazi weapons, radar systems and even the deployment of the feared V-1 and V-2 rockets used to terrorize London. Corera also reveals the part played by America&#x2019;s specialist military pigeon units, such as their role in Operation Columba and their work in North Africa and Europe, including on D-Day.</p><p>The people who sent these messages were not trained spies. They were ordinary men and women, fearful and half-starved, willing to risk their lives in the name of freedom. Some even formed amateur espionage organizations, including the Leopold Vindictive network&#x2014;a small group of Belgian villagers led by an extraordinary priest named Joseph Raskin.

Keeping to the engaging, accessible language of Piercy&#x2019;s novels, the collection spans decades of her writing along with a range of locations, ages, and emotional states of her protagonists. From the first-person account of hoarding and a girl&#x2019;s narrative of sexual and spiritual discovery to the recounting of a past love affair, each story is a tangible, vivid snapshot in a varied and subtly curated gallery of work. Whether grappling with death, familial relationships, friendship, sex, illness, or religion, Piercy&#x2019;s writing is as passionate, lucid, insightful, and thoughtfully alive as ever.</p></p><p><p><b>Marge Piercy</b> is the author of 17 novels, including the national bestsellers <i>Braided Lives</i>, <i>Gone to Soldiers</i>, and <i>Woman on the Edge of Time</i>; 17 volumes of poetry; and a critically acclaimed memoir, <i>Sleeping with Cats</i>.

She lives in Wellfleet, Massachusetts.</p><p>&#x201c;The author displays an old-fashioned narrative drive and a set of well-realized characters permitted to lead their own believably odd lives.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Thomas Mallon, <i>Newsday </i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;This reviewer knows no other writer with Piercy&#x2019;s gifts for tracing the emotional route that two people take to a double bed, and the mental games and gambits each transacts there.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Ron Grossman, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;Marge Piercy is not just an author, she&#x2019;s a cultural touchstone. Few writers in modern memory have sustained her passion, and skill, for creating stories of consequence.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br></p><p>&#x201c;As always, Piercy writes with high intelligence, love for the world, ethical passion, and innate feminism.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Adrienne Rich, feminist and author, <i>A Change of World</i><br><br></p>"Piercy homes in on her characters, mixing just the right amount of humor into her always insightful take on imperfect human relationships, in their many guises." &#x2014;Deborah Donovan, <i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Piercy's debut short-story collection heralds the beloved feminist writer's return to fiction after a long hiatus.

For a journey into the feminine psyche it is unparalleled." &#x2014;Sally Hughes, welovethisbook.com<br><br>"With uncompromising emotional intensity, Piercy captures the complex female experience in her debut short story collection. Powerful in scope, the collection feels driven by an idea rather than a story, demonstrating Pierce&#x2019;s understanding of how social constructs evolve in deeply personal ways." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;What Piercy has that Danielle Steel, for example, does not is an ability to capture life&#x2019;s complex texture, to chart shifting relationships and evolving consciousness within the context of political and economic realities she delineates with mordant matter-of-factness." &#x2014;Wendy Smith, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br><br>"Though stuffed with heavy topics, <i>The Cost of Lunch, Etc.</i> is the perfect poolside literary pick." &#x2014;glo-mag.com</p><h2>Cassidy&#39;s Girl</h2><p>They say that a man needs a woman to go to hell with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassidy had two.&nbsp;&nbsp;One was Mildred, the wife who kept him chained with ties of fear and jealousy and paralyzing sexual need.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other was Doris, a frail angel with a 100-proof halo and a bottle instead of a harp.&nbsp;&nbsp;With those two, Cassidy found that the ride to hell could be twice as fast.<br><br>Cassidy's Girl has all the traits that made its author a virtuoso of the hard-boiled: a fiercely compelling ploy; characters who self-destruct in spectacularly unpredictable ways; and an insider's knowledge of all the routes to the bottom.</p><p>"Goodis has an originality of naturalism . . . a creatively compelling vividness of detail." --<b>San Francisco Chronicle</b></p><h2>The Wednesday Witch</h2><p>Mary Jane&#39;s mother has told her not to let any strangers in the house while she&#39;s away.

He taught social anthropology at Queen&#39;s University, Belfast. He is an Honorary Associate of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, and an Associate of the School for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto.$$$In the 1970s he worked with the Canadian Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and then with Inuit and Indian organisations, mapping hunter-gatherer territories and researching Land Claims and indigenous rights in many parts of Canada. He was an adviser to the Mackenzie Pipeline Inquiry, a member of the World Bank&#39;s famous Morse Commission and chairman of the Snake River Independent Review, all of which took him to the encounter between large-scale development and indigenous communities. Since 1997 he has worked with the South African San Institute on Bushman history and land rights in the Southern Kalahari.&#39;A wonderful book... Most of all, it is superb anthropology, challenging many of the accepted notions about the lives of hunters.&#39; Paul Theroux</p><h2>Beethoven or Bust: A Practical Guide to Understanding and Listening to Great Music</h2><p>Offers an accessible introduction to classical music for those with little or no musical training and suggests &#34;listening groups&#34; of compositions to build musical comprehension</p><p>Irreverent, off-beat and yet brimming with an informed and enthusiastic love of all kinds of music, this is a unique and easy to understand introduction to classical music for the uninitiated--those with a budding curiosity, but not the slightest idea where to start.Meant as an alternative to conventional "music appreciation" texts, this book might have been subtitled "A Lifetime Listening Plan," because that's about how long it would take to do justice to its ambitious program. The heart of the book consists of 88 "listening groups," each comprised of four major classical works linked by a short essay. The piquant juxtapositions suggested in many of these groups can certainly enhance a listener's understanding and enjoyment. What may daunt all but the most dedicated, however, is the fact that many of these groups contain well over four hours of music, which must be heard a number of times to be digested. Two more caveats: the conversational writing style is at times self-indulgent, even annoying, and some quirky opinions are presented as facts. Recommended for larger collections as a supplement, not a substitute, for standard texts.<br><i>- E.

Ron Hubbard is the founder of Scientology. He has described his philosophies in more than 5,000 writings, including dozens of books, and three thousand tape recorded lectures. Those who regularly employ his teachings to improve themselves and help their fellows come from all walks of life. The universal acclaim for the man &#x2014; including thousands of awards and recognitions from individuals and groups and the unprecedented popularity of his works among all people &#x2014; is but one indicator of the effectiveness of his technologies. More importantly, there are millions of people around the world who consider they have no greater friend.As a radiation safety professional, I take particular interest in the use of the program for those individuals who have been affected by radiation accidents, such as the residents living near the sites of accidents in the former Soviet Union. The variety of effects that can be associated with exposure to radiation from these events is still being studied. In the mean time, my concern in these cases is in the use of effective measures to return to health those who have been exposed. "In Kazakhstan, a group of men who worked on the repair and recovery from the Chernobyl disaster were suffering from the various illnesses that appeared to have been related to their exposure to radiation at the damaged reactor. These men had been ill for several years, and had not responded to standard medical treatments. These individuals were placed on the Purification program, and all reported recovery from the debilitating conditions from which they had suffered. --James G.

As soon became apparent, however, Maxwell had been a great pretender whose fiscal chicanery marked him among the globe's meanest and most daring swindlers. In his authoritative, dirt-dishing audit of the mercurial Maxwell's career, Fleet Street veteran Greenslade dashes any lingering notion that much good was interred with his subject's bones. The author made the most of his relatively brief tenure at London's Daily Mirror--the UK's top tabloid as well as Maxwell's flagship paper--accumulating a wealth of anecdotal evidence on his employer's autocratic, boorish, meddlesome, and secretive management style. While Greenslade doesn't claim to have realized that the Czech-born Maxwell was looting the pension funds of companies under his control, he decided, after evaluating the leveraged condition of the proprietor's publicly held and private enterprises (British Printing, Macmillan, Mirror Group Newspapers, New York's Daily News, etc.), to withdraw from the corporate retirement program. Meanwhile, the author recounts, he, fellow journalists, and analysts in The City (London's Wall Street) had precious few doubts that an overextended ``Cap'n Bob'' was heading for a fall because of his inability to meet debt-service obligations--and because of what associates dubbed ``the Max factor.'' That the truth of the matter turned out to be far worse than imagined was due, Greenslade says, to the vagaries of English business and libel law, plus Maxwell's litigiousness and willingness to run risky bluffs in pursuit of illusory rewards. He concludes that Maxwell committed suicide rather than face the disgrace of exposure as a lifelong grifter. Although Greenslade has an axe to grind, he sets a high standard by offering an objective if unsparing portrait of a villain who was often in error but seldom in doubt. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this juicy, relentlessly unflattering, at times vindictive portrait of Robert Maxwell, who died mysteriously last November, Greenslade strips away the facade of the boastful press baron to portray a panic-stricken con man who massively plundered his public companies and his employees' pension funds in an effort to save his debt-ridden empire. Greenslade was editor of London's Maxwell-owned Daily Mirror until March 1991, when he left because of the tycoon's "gross editorial interference." The Maxwell who swaggers through these acid pages is a shameless self-promoter, a windbag politician during his six years in Parliament, an authoritarian boss given to violent mood swings and a brutal, tyrannical father to his seven children. His marriage was such "a sham" that he and his wife Betty lived apart despite a public show of unity, Greenslade reports. He also details Maxwell's misuse of company funds and, with support from a pathologist's report, argues that the press lord probably committed suicide because he could not face the public disgrace of "being revealed as a cheat and a thief."
